That these lightly armed ships and their air crews managed to hold off Admiral Kurita's vanguard and prevent an assault on the vulnerable ships supporting the Allied ground invasion, remains one of WWII's most incredible, and most gallant moments. Some of the vessels that may appear in the film include Taffy 3's carrier USS Gambier Bay (CVE-73), and the destroyers USS Johnston (DD-557), USS Hoel (DD-533), USS Heerman (DD-532), and Samuel B.

This transition is driven by Hindutva, a Hindu supremacist ideology embodied by Narendra Modi. For the past 10 years, Prime Minister Modi has relentlessly pursued his fascist policy based on Hindu supremacy. This ideology of hatred towards other religions in the country, particularly Islam, has also spread globally. Those who follow this belief want India to be only for Hindus, treating people of other religions, like Muslims or Sikhs as second-class citizens. Attacks against Christians have surged by 400% since Modi's election, accompanied by discriminatory laws targeting Muslims and widespread lynching incidents. Hindutva's influence permeates all levels of Indian society.

And Hoffmann's tale of the troubled child who must go on a wonderful (and occasionally terrifying) journey of discovery has a universal and timeless appeal.  Bart's production for the Staatsoper Unter den Linden in Berlin builds on Petipa's original choreography and develops the context of the child Marie's (Nadja Saidakova) anxiety into a strong narrative. The godfather Drosselmayer (Oliver Matz) is initially a sinister figure, forcing her to confront past events before leading her into the glittering land of the Sugar Plum Fairy.

Other than the boatman who ferries back and forth to the mainland, the island's only inhabitants are a fisherman and his very pretty daughter Eleni (Eleni Drogoumi). Eleni seems a bit different right from the beginning; on the one hand, she likes wandering around dressed only in a long shirt, and on the other, she has a penchant for swimming all night with the dolphins. When the usually arrogant geologist starts transferring some of his interest from rocks to Eleni's comings-and-goings, he wonders if there is not something fishy about her parentage.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/7/5/3/3/8/275338-l-arbre-sous-la-mer-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=f74a865c2b"},{"name":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn","tagline":"","description":"The adventures of a teen-aged boy and his friend, a runaway slave, as they float down the Mississippi River on a raft.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/3/7/8/7/1/737871-the-adventures-of-huckleberry-finn-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=bf04eefdbf"},{"name":"Hania","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/7/5/5/4/117554-hania-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=f049209e9f"},{"name":"The Family or Schroffenstein","tagline":"","description":"The aristocratic families of Rossitz and Warwand, who are relatives, have started to treat each other with mistrust and hatred, since a testamentary contract has stated, that the complete goods will be inherited to the respective surviving line.
