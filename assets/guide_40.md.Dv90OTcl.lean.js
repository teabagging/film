The novel is a tremendously optical reading of objects and landscapes made by a jealous husband who deforms and subjectivizes reality. The film objectifies the texts in the same way by putting them as they are on the screen, but so is the reading of free texts and languages and associations. As the poster that the artist himself made says: In 1957 Alain Robbe-Grillet published La Celosa. In 1972 Isidoro Valcrcel has taken it to the cinema.

It is also perhaps the first effort to privilege the voices of the Iraqi people, from all walks of life as well as social, economic and ethnic backgrounds. While many have talked about and for the Iraqi people, few media outlets have sought to probe beyond the simplistic binary of pro-US/pro-Saddam perspective so often found in Western and Arab media portrayals of Iraq. About Baghdad presents Iraqis who describe the pain, complexity and suffering of living under decades of tyranny, oppression, wars, sanctions and now occupation.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/7/4/6/4/6/474646-about-baghdad-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=e8dd34c98f"},{"name":"Let the Good Times Roll","tagline":"","description":"Lost on their way to a desert rock concert, two loners remember the good times.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Kino Citius","tagline":"","description":"An award winning short film from Guy Roland.
