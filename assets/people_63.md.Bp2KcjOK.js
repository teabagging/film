These lyrical interludes (in this movie the in-between is at the heart of the matter) are punctuated by rescanned YouTube interviews with authors/philosophers/scientists Jorge Luis Borges, Francisco Varela, Julio Cortazar, Beatriz Preciado and Gilles Deleuze.

Between 1967 and 1973, the British government progressively evicted the islander population from their homelands to allow the United States to build a huge military base on Diego Garcia, the largest of the islands. The base was strategically important to the US and British involvement in Afghanistan and other Middle Eastern fields of military operation. No consultation took place with the Chagossian people, and they were given no choice.  As the film powerfully documents, the islanders were forced to survive in shanty towns in Mauritius and the Seychelles and were given no prospect of ever returning to their home. Many of them survive today in inadequate housing and poor living conditions, unwelcomed by their host communities.

Time-lapse cinematography marks time passing, clouds and shadows moving as the women slowly descend into the earth. They are very positive, very upbeat, but their sinking is inevitable.
