Modern Conservatism is depicted as arising from opposition to Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, becoming a national movement in the 1960's and reaching its apex with Ronald Reagan. Modern Liberalism has its roots in the progressive era of the 1890's becoming dominant with the New Deal, and losing influence with the perceived failures of the \\"Great Society programs\\" and Vietnam war policies of Lyndon Johnson.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/1/6/6/7/7/616677-american-feud-a-history-of-conservatives-and-liberals-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=f0ffc90e36"},{"name":"Aljubarrota","tagline":"","description":"A commission from CIBA - Battle of Aljubarrota Interpretation Center, from the Batalha de Aljubarrota Foundation.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/5/5/5/2/8/855528-aljubarrota-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=73ab23231b"},{"name":"Kens","tagline":"","description":"When love is true, no one can ever separate it.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/3/3/8/3/4/933834-kens-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=b452f18fc3"},{"name":"Hollywood Cavalcade: The Silent Dream","tagline":"","description":"Special featurette included on the Hollywood Cavalcade (1939) DVD.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"L'Anne des Guignols - La France d'aprs","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/0/5/3/5/6/305356-les-guignols-de-l-info-la-france-d-apres-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=c9a970c0c3"},{"name":"Pomeranie","tagline":"","description":"There are places in which space is turned inside out, and time is flowing backwards.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/3/0/2/9/0/430290-pomeranie-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=0ac752c642"},{"name":"Den Helder","tagline":"","description":"Den Helder, just another town somewhere in the North of Holland.

In the hands of Canadian born Allan Moffat, the Phase I, II and III GTHOs set fire to the imagination of Ford fans across the country.  In this DVD, we trace the origins of the GT from the original Falcon XR GT piloted to victory at Bathurst by Fred Gibson and Harry Firth, through the Moffat glory days and dominance at Bathurst in 1970 and 1971, right through to the GTHO that never raced, and perhaps the ultimate version, the Phase IV. Adding to this high octane mix are the drivers who helped create the legend, Allan Moffat, Fred Gibson, John Goss and John French.

The shooting location was a building with only walls and floors, whether it was under construction or being demolished. I decided on the composition so that the wall and floor exactly intersect in the center of the screen. In order to capture 1/4 of the screen, 3/4 of the screen must be covered with a mask. Then, while rewinding the film, I took four shots at different frame speeds. One cut, one scene, a fixed screen with no camera work. The same man is walking in each part of the continuous screen, which is divided into four parts.

The geometry of Brain Field, as a result, is static and consists of color-activated nonrelational forms. Varying envelopes of space are created throughout Brain Field by orchestrating the attack and decay of color sensations.

The picture frame, which has its own autonomy, limits the \\"view\\" to a simple economy: inside / outside. The nature of the \\"interior\\" is determined by the composition and detail, \\"outside\\" there is an unknown space that is never fully described. The fixed frame represents the intentionality of phenomenological consciousness, but at the same time it defines the limits of what is visible and knowable.
