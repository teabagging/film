The annual pilgrimage is ignored by national and local media, as India's ruling castes reinforce systemic caste-based discrimination by either erasing this history or deeming it antinational.

The film also investigates why America went from a country which produced vast quantities of the non-narcotic industrial hemp, to the complete ban on hemp production in 1938.
