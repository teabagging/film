While inspired by soft-porn aesthetics, it defies the anticipated imagery and familiar mood of pornographic content.

One pilot spends 14 years building the airplane of his dreams, only to suffer a crash landing that destroys the aircraft-- but not his determination. An aerobatic pilot flies circles around her competition in a mans world. A pilot reveals the secret fears that nearly all pilots have of flying, and how that keeps them alive. Filled with seasoned wisdom and candid humor, The Disciples of Flight re-defines what it is to be a pilot who is truly in love with aviation. Join us as we seek to understand what it feels like to fly a small airplane, why people are so driven to aviation, and how the life long devotion some aviators feel toward flying has changed their lives forever.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Dear Husband","tagline":"","description":"Steve and Funmilola are happily married.
