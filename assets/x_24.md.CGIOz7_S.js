The second verse explores regression and correlation with visuals of scatter plots, while the bridge emphasizes confidence intervals (\\"Hold my hand, in a confidence band\\") to highlight parameter estimation uncertainty. The final chorus celebrates significance levels (\\"Fill my p-value with data, let me know what stats are like on Jupiter and Mars\\"), making statistical concepts relatable.
