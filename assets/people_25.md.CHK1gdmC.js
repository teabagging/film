Whether it concerns Greet Hofmans, extramarital affairs, or Lockheed, Prince Bernhard faced a lot of scandals throughout the course of his life. Besides this he was, and is a person, loved by many as a war hero. A man of extremes. In four parts Prince Bernhard tells the tale of his life. Not only through the spyglass, but especially to his grandson's wife, Princess Mxima of the Netherlands, who will be soon the Queen next to Prince Willem-Alexander. In a way, she takes the same position as Prince Bernhard did in his life. In their conversations and discussions it becomes clear how much they are different, but also how much they are the same. For Princess Mxima this is sometimes very confronting.

In this work, test cards, bots, virtual assistants, stock photos and others find a voice, but fail to recover their personhood. As Menkman states, Engineers used these female objects to evaluate the quality of image processing, rendering and composition of architecture and to make these latent spaces more amicable. While these women seem to be able to prolong their existence for as long as the (digital) realms will copy and reuse them, most of them have lost their name and identity.

My mother did not want children.  She wanted to free herself from domestic contingencies.  She became a civil servant and a city dweller.  All my life, I had to deal with this aversion that she transmitted to me.  Having chosen to live in the countryside, I find myself in my turn monopolized by my home.  It is from my kitchen and my computer screen that I reconstruct our women's journeys under the influence of household and family obligations.  My grandmother carried buckets of water with a yoke every day.  Today my friends are coming back to washable diapers.  I summon people, places and archives to question my intimate history by dialoguing with Michelle Perrot, historian of women's emancipation.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/4/3/5/8/9/643589-femme-de-mere-en-fille-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=88817b9f67"},{"name":"The Ship","tagline":"I'm going to be the best bartender in the world.","description":"A camera crew follows Charlie at his painful first shift as a bartender at The Ship.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/8/9/0/4/9/989049-the-ship-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=68fd4fdf36"},{"name":"If only I knew how to love...","tagline":"You are the music in me ??????","description":"An (attempted) political reinterpretation of the Myth of Orpheus: A journey towards a better kind of love","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/8/5/4/3/0/985430-if-only-i-knew-how-to-love--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=99b9a3949e"},{"name":"Colors","tagline":"Do you see yourself in the colors?","description":"An experimental stop motion film","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/8/4/6/0/3/984603-colors-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=c104ab244c"},{"name":"its like nothing happened","tagline":"\\"Let me pass...\\"","description":"Quincy, a college student, eats a \\"Cinnamon Ice Cube\\" that leads him on a drug-fueled ride of insane visions.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/8/7/5/9/6/987596-its-like-nothing-happened-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=6398af29cc"},{"name":"whatever you do, DO NOT HOT SHOWER","tagline":"Red by dawn","description":"To relieve stress, a man steps into his shower doors for a nice hot shower.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/7/4/1/2/7/974127-whatever-you-do-do-not-hot-shower-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=41bc49d7d9"},{"name":"In These Parkas We Can Only Be Warm","tagline":"That's why I was hoping that you would get good grades.","description":"Two parka-adorned silhouettes engage in a barely-audible conversation about Snapchat, grades, money, and other unintelligible topics, until one notices something on the other's glasses.

He hoped that future generations of scientists would make the discoveries necessary to validate his ideas. Today, after more than 150 years of exploration fossil evidence of slow, incremental biological change has yet to be excavated. Instead, we find a picture of the rapid appearance of fully developed, complex organisms during the outset of the Cambrian geological era. Organisms that embody almost all of the major animal body plans that exist today. This remarkable explosion of life is best explained by the existence of a transcendent intelligence.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/5/9/3/8/105938-darwin-s-dilemma-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=5ac857ae3d"},{"name":"Get The Picture","tagline":"","description":"A curious girl, with a long for something new, she finds an abandoned object that allows her to capture the world from a completely different point of view.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Dekh Bhai Dekh","tagline":"","description":"Dekh Bhai Dekh (Hindi: ??? ??? ???) is a 2009 Bollywood comedy film directed by Rahat Kazmi featuring Gracy Singh and Siddharth Koirala in the lead roles","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/2/8/7/9/92879-dekh-bhai-dekh-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=6af66fd679"},{"name":"Feel","tagline":"","description":"Novella from the almanac \\"Crush\\" (2009)","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/6/7/2/9/3/667293-feel-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=bd3ba87515"},{"name":"Geniet och pojkarna","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Pitching Man: Satchel Paige Defying Time","tagline":"","description":"Celebrate the life of baseballs most enduring legend; Satchel Paige was the single most important player in the old Negro Baseball Leagues","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/1/1/1/2/1/911121-pitching-man-satchel-paige-defying-time-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=c21e3a0941"},{"name":"Surviving Alone in Alaska","tagline":"","description":"Heimo Korth is the last man standing in 19 million acres of Alaskan wilderness.
