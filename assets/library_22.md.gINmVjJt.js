Even as the battle was ongoing, however, allegations swirled that regular units of the Russian army had joined the battle on the side of the separatists, tipping the balance decisively in their favour. Russia denied the charges. But, in what became a watershed moment for open source investigation, communities of researchers, reporters, and citizen journalists gathered substantial and compelling open source evidence for the presence of the Russian military in the region.  This video is a documentary piece that ventures both into the realms of science and politics (its part of the body of evidence submitted to the European Court of Human Rights in the form of an interactive platform).","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/8/2/5/0/0/682500-the-battle-of-ilovaisk-verifying-russian-military-presenc-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=63efc51b62"},{"name":"Pure Gold","tagline":"","description":"In the grip of a famine, a farmer must provide for his starving family, however his desperation is exploited by a mischievous being, that tempts him with something precious.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/0/3/8/7/0/703870-pure-gold-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=fa82ed594e"},{"name":"O Amigo do Rei","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/4/5/4/7/5/545475-o-amigo-do-rei-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=6dceab1bcf"},{"name":"Searching for the Perfect Gentleman","tagline":"","description":"\\"Searching for the Perfect Gentleman  an Investigative Journey\\" is a documentary about the search of an African barber shop poster.

Whilst most men would weep and think back over their lives, Thierry thought about coming back - to do a rally across the Sahara Desert. The 9000km Paris-Dakar, the world's craziest race, was born.  The rally became a beacon for eccentric adventurers battling the terrain in customised vehicles, seduced by the romance of the desert and the extreme challenge. It soon became a victim of its own rapid success, shrouded in controversy, overwhelmed by corporate interests, responsible for over 60 deaths and decreed vulgar by the Vatican. Finally, in 2008, this incredible event was brought to an end by terrorism.  This is the story of the biggest motorsport event the world has ever seen and one of the greatest challenges of human endeavour ever conceived, from those that took part.

By Swiss composer Arthur Honegger, Jeanne d'Arc au B?cher (1938) is an imposing oratorio. The libretto is a highly original creation by French poet and playwright Paul Claudel, who dramatises the last moments of the martyr's life. Originally written for actress Ida Rubinstein, the oratorio is written as a flashback in which Joan recalls her life, just before she dies. Honegger creates visually evocative ambiances and fills the orchestra with new sounds (saxophones, ondes Martenot). The initial prologue to the piece was added in 1944 as a symbol of the resistance during the Nazi occupation of France: again, Joan goes beyond her own story.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/3/0/5/3/3/930533-joan-of-arc-at-the-stake-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=373a9e5bdf"},{"name":"Love Is...

A perfectionist to the extreme, he struggled with every word of those few poems for many years before he consented to see them published. When he did, six of them were condemned by the state censors as obscene. It was surely a powerful blow to him to have such a significant part of his life's work so rudely suppressed. This courtroom drama follows him at the 1857 trial at which he defended his works. The filmmaker has chosen to symbolically re-enact certain poems about the love of a woman as they are being read for the court.
