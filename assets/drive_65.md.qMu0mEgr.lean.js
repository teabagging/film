In \\"Deanimated\\" the actors are gradually eliminated and thus the narrative loses its coherence. What remains are backgrounds, erratic camera movements that seem to move without focus throughout the room, capturing ghostly changes in light and shadows.  In this project, Arnold asks fundamental philosophical questions about human existence and presence in absence. Although the actors are missing, they leave behind traces (such as smashing bullets together, dust stirring up ) and are experienced precisely in their absence as a ghostly, unreal present.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/7/3/8/0/0/173800-deanimated-the-invisible-ghost-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=6e10dda8c7"},{"name":"Sons","tagline":"","description":"Story of a real family in Beijing.

The serenity of the film, which is structurally reflected by Huots presentation of the action from a single position in a single take, its sensuality, and the aura of ritual it creates (Raj always moves in a formal way and, except when she needs to look for the paint, looks modestly down) make Black and White Film a quietly haunting work.Scott MacDonald, The Films of Robert Huot: 1967 to 1972, Quarterly Review of Film Studies, Summer 1980.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/6/0/9/4/5/360945-black-and-white-film-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=c5a94b6814"},{"name":"Heitor dos Prazeres","tagline":"","description":"Artist Heitor dos Prazeres talks about his life as a painter and samba musician.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/3/2/2/7/4/432274-heitor-dos-prazeres-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=2f02cd70fb"},{"name":"La Chevelure","tagline":"","description":"A man developes an obsession with a wig.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/8/3/5/1/7/283517-la-chevelure-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=52e5b74648"},{"name":"Innocent Sinners","tagline":"","description":"A neglected girl in post-World War II London befriends street urchins who help her build a tiny garden in a bombed-out church.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/3/5/0/7/3/135073-innocent-sinners-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=253053a921"},{"name":"Images pour Debussy","tagline":"","description":"This film illustrates Debussy's works \\"En bateau\\", \\"Arabesques\\", \\"Reflets dans l'eau\\" and \\"Arabesques en sol\\".

Rather than observing it from a distance, he chose to become part of this discreet and beleaguered community. He strives to support their cause, getting involved in law suits and confronting companies which pillage land that belongs to the Indians with complete impunity.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/5/1/2/6/105126-the-ethnographer-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=e01234a8fe"},{"name":"Kill Keith","tagline":"SAW meets RICHARD & JUDY!","description":"Keith Chegwin becomes embroiled in a murderous spree involving television presenters.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/0/9/6/0/70960-kill-keith-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=cbbd792a7b"},{"name":"Ramin","tagline":"A lullaby for the champion","description":"Ramin, an ex-wrestler who once won seven matches in 55 seconds, lives alone in the east Georgian town of Kvareli.

Kiss: Exposed returns us to that forgettable era, as Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons show how to desperately try to remain cock rock's elder statesmen. This 1987 compilation serves up several now-hilarious video clips from Kiss's '80s \\"unmasked\\" period, including \\"Tears Are Falling,\\" \\"Heaven's on Fire,\\" \\"Lick It Up,\\" and \\"I Love It Loud.\\" (Count the fires burning in these classic video relics of days gone by!) Also on hand are Stanley and Simmons themselves, looking properly embarrassed as they act out rock's biggest fantasy: lounging by the pool with a bevy of (mostly) bare beauties. The saving grace is the generous selection of vintage live performances: hearing the band do \\"Strutter,\\" \\"Detroit Rock City,\\" \\"Ladies Room,\\" and \\"Deuce\\" in its late-'70s prime is worth wading through the outdated '80s-style power pop... if you're a real Kiss fan, of course.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/6/3/6/3/116363-kiss-exposed-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=4244b700ac"},{"name":"Salom","tagline":"The most erotic woman in history and the dance that destroyed a dynasty...","description":"John the Baptist, the prophet of Israel, is imprisoned by Herod, governor of Judea for protesting Herod's marriage to his brother's wife.
