JJ Stratfords formal exploration of the LZX Video Synthesizer and the Fairlight Computer Video Instrument (CVI) resulted in a suite of 10 short experimental videos questioning obsolescence and early video aesthetics. At first glance, one could mistakenly take this work to be a study of dead-media fetishism. However, one watches this suite unfold into a delicate investigation of the limits of technology, and the potential those limits enable. Through the use of preset wipes and crude RGB color palettes, Stratford uncovers hidden potential in what otherwise would be considered a long-outmoded device for creative expression. In doing so, the typical subversive gesture of using obsolete technology that occurs within contemporary art is supplanted by an earnest exploration into a crucial link between early video aesthetics and current technologically inflected imagery.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"The Fall of Occupy LA","tagline":"","description":"The fall of the Occupy LA camp.

In transit their status and human rights become negligible as they become illegal immigrants. What motivates them is usually universal; poverty, war, fear. They travel by foot, hide inside cars, are shipped in trucks and buses, and many travel by boat. In our globalised world the boundaries are open for trade but closed for immigration, their numbers are reported aligned with political motivations, the complexity of the individual story and its outcome, whether dead or alive, is skimmed over as the next news piece is ranked precedence.

The search for the truth by Jasons sister runs parallel to the filmmakers investigation of light. This radical documentary film combines moving testimonies, poetry and a political analysis of state violence. Emotional and disturbing, Po Po is more evidence that the IPCC are complicit in the lack of successful prosecutions of police officers for deaths in their custody. In the end, what emerges in the light is the need for resistance.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Le Cinema","tagline":"","description":"A short film made for Venezia 70 C Future Reloaded (2013).
