From the need for greater accuracy in measuring time, gnomons and solar quadrants arose, for whose reading the duodecimal numbering is used. Based on this numbering, time zones and mechanical measuring devices were established, illustrated by the clock mechanism with a church bell. The evolution of astronomy determines the creation of more accurate electronic devices for the evaluation of time, such as the meridian telescope, the Markowitz chamber, the electronic oscillators and the telescope, with which astronomers work at the National Observatory.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/3/9/5/3/7/739537-a-medida-do-tempo-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=f044c5d948"},{"name":"Pernkov chaloupka","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Dewey Boulevard","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/9/6/6/7/2/896672-dewey-boulevard-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=8618af4b7b"},{"name":"Alhabu alsaamat","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/7/6/5/9/8/1076598-alhabu-alsaamat-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=f367c586b8"},{"name":"Ulilang Anghel","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/8/2/0/0/6/882006-ulilang-anghel-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=7a3594b6cc"},{"name":"Thirumanam","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Palaboy","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/9/6/6/6/5/896665-palaboy-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=f63c28c4c7"},{"name":"El hombre del paraguas blanco","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/7/9/1/7/0/379170-el-hombre-del-paraguas-blanco-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=0fe62b812e"},{"name":"  ?","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/8/9/4/6/5/889465---0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=060431d732"},{"name":"A Boy and Three Mothers","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/9/6/1/7/0/1096170-a-boy-and-three-mothers-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=9531ae0e07"},{"name":"Jabulani Afrika","tagline":"","description":"A BAFTA award nominated documentary featuring native African musicians and dancers.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Sol","tagline":"","description":"Varied colors and patterns created on an optical projector.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Une sortie de novices de Sakpata","tagline":"","description":"Sakpata is one of the main deities of the \\"Vodoun\\" pantheon in Benin (Dahomey at the time of filming, in 1958).

In his works, Spengemann negotiates subjects that elude technical and industrial reproduction (e.g. life itself, the universe, chance), but does so by hyper-technical means. He builds replicas of mistakes, connects pixels to make polygons, which then become specks of dust, threads, or bits of fluff, which condense in the dark cavern of a trouser pocket. In this way, he re-asks the fundamental ontologi- cal question of what substance the world is really made of and how in this materialist perspective anything new can emerge C without retreating into esotericism and metaphysics.\\"  Excerpt of: Martin Karcher, But the laser steers all things, 2021","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/9/4/5/4/3/894543-pocket-call-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=aa82b8bdde"},{"name":"A Pocketful of Song","tagline":"","description":"A bustling market street chimes with the gentle chaos of a lone, decades-old collectable coin and stamp shop in its midst.
