She has been absent for some time, ever since she left - still a girl - to be a soldier. With determination and sacrifice, Manuela laboriously built the life she dreamed of, until she became an army non-commissioned officer and platoon commander in an advanced base in the Afghan desert, responsible for the life and death of thirty men. But the bloody attack in which she was seriously wounded forces her into a very different and no less insidious war: against memories, disillusionment and pain, but also against the stereotypical role of woman and victim that society tries to impose on her. The meeting with the mysterious guest of the Hotel Bellavista, Mattia, a man apparently without a past and, like her, suspended in his own personal limbo of expectation and hope, is an opportunity to come to terms with his story. And to find that life is always worth living - because nobody, not even her, is what they seem.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/3/0/9/1/9/330919-limbo-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=eb65cff38b"},{"name":"16-Nov","tagline":"The night that changed Australian football","description":"After 32 years of heartache, bitterness and despair, it took just seconds for Guus Hiddink to exude a rare sense of calmness in the Socceroos dressing room.  Four years prior to the now famous night on November 16, 2005, a fragile Australian team had been bullied off the park by Uruguay in its quest to finally break its World Cup drought.  Intimidated from the moment they touched down in Montevideo in 2001, spat on by locals and then roared off the park by 60,000 manic fans in the Estadio Centenario, they had barely stood a chance.  Now older, more mature and  with Hiddink in charge  more professional, things would be different four years on.  That change in mentality flows through November 16, a gripping documentary from Richard Bayliss and Ben Coonan that depicts the Socceroos journey from West Germany in 1974 to the moment John Aloisis crisp spot kick struck the back of Fabian Carinis net.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/1/8/7/3/4/318734-november-16-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=5759977962"},{"name":"El nome de los rboles","tagline":"","description":"A small film crew moves through Asturias in search of the places where the main ambushes against the Republican Guerrilla (1937-1952) took place.

There are plenty of buildings to see, even when the train is not at the station.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/9/0/9/8/2/790982-the-arlberg-railway-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=e1dfce3146"},{"name":"Whence Does He Come?","tagline":"","description":"Backward facing camera stunt story of a man coming out of the water.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/9/6/4/9/8/796498-whence-does-he-come--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=65677e6e08"},{"name":"Latina, Physical Culture Poses (No. 1)","tagline":"","description":"A full-length view, photographed from the audience, of a woman dressed in tights doing calisthenics.

There is no plot. The thread that holds this full-length feature together is an animated hippie character who sits in his living room listening to a Los Angeles radio station while smoking marijuana. His high allows him to dream up all the images on-screen. Although the film is overly long and, for that reason, seems disconnected, the photography and art work (by Patrick) are quite enjoyable. The picture seems meant to be viewed by young people and might find appeal in selective showcasing. Anton Noel produced, directed and wrote the film, done in four-channel Quadrophonic sound.
