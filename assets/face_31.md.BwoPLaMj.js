Immortal Stories is an exploration of those hidden zones of great cities haunted by literary ideas and characters. It depicts the endless wandering of an artist undergoing an increasingly detached and disjointed experience of contemporary life. In this latest feature-length work, documentarian and critic Fergus Daly again negotiates the intersection of art, cinema and philosophy.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/4/0/1/8/7/1040187-immortal-stories-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=568eba5824"},{"name":"Juste le meilleur des galas 2015 - Les 7 pchs capitaux","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/1/9/3/1/7/419317-juste-le-meilleur-des-galas-2015-les-7-peches-capitaux-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=0f682fa089"},{"name":"Motel","tagline":"","description":"There is a motel in the countryside.

It was cluttered and hazardous, which made it difficult to believe that the home had ever been a working invention.

So who were the winners and losers? The Axis nations lost in the big-picture sense. Germany in particular was defeated, occupied, humiliated, discredited and shamed. But Germany quickly became relevant again as two of the Allies, the United States and Soviet Union, engaged in a decades-long ideological Cold War. Great Britain, meanwhile, was on the winning side but lost its empire and global clout. It also turned inward, nationalizing key sectors of its economy. Japan and Germany were in better positions 20 years after the war. Victor Davis Hanson digs into all of those post-war developments and more in this final episode of our six-part Freedom Academy lecture series.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Hyena Boys","tagline":"","description":"Follow Nigerias elusive hyena boys into their secret world of animal magic and voodoo.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"L'effet Placebo","tagline":"","description":"The placebo effect has long enjoyed a notorious reputation. To attribute a cure to the placebo effect, was to consider, with a touch of contempt, that the illness was the product of the mental state of a hypochondriac. If he invented his illness, he could invent his cure. Now, in contradiction to these theories, scientific studies carried out over recent decades show that the placebo effect can result in physiological changes that are both observable and quantifiable. By means of a rigorous investigation this film aims to shed fresh light on a powerful phenomenon that is associated with every medical act, in order to lift the veil on part of its mystery and begin to explore our formidable power for self-healing.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/7/7/0/7/3/1177073-l-effet-placebo-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=f86eea4b08"},{"name":"Pikaso Silta Vasaras Diena","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Volver","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Stand-up bez cenzury","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/3/3/9/6/6/233966-stand-up-bez-cenzury-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=780fd2e5be"},{"name":"First Death","tagline":"","description":"\\"The First Death\\" is the second film in the series of documentaries \\"Winter that changed us\\".

In 1903, the French brothers Auguste and Louis Lumiere patented the colour photography process and pioneered colour photography. On the German side of the line was the famous photographer Hans Hildenbrand. This powerful documentary brings those rare images to light. Of course the story of the Great War wasn't just recorded in photographs.

These natural advantages and its location on the main trade route from the Galilee to Damascus made Dan the most important city of the northern part of the Kingdom of Israel. After the death of Solomon the kingdom was divided and God entrusted Jeroboam with the government of the northern ten tribes (1 Kings 11:30-31).

In just over a year, Bowie's messianic Martian invaded the minds of the nation's youth with a killer combination of extraterrestrial rock 'n' roll and outrageous sexuality, all delivered in high-heeled boots, multi-coloured dresses and extravagant make-up. In Bowie's own words, Ziggy was 'a cross between Nijinsky and Woolworths', but this unlikely culture clash worked - Ziggy turned Bowie into stardust. This documentary tells the story of how Bowie arrived at one of the most iconic creations in the history of pop music. The songs, the hairstyles, the fashion and the theatrical stage presentation that merged together to turn David Bowie into the biggest craze since the Beatles.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Paris, au fil de l'eau","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/3/2/9/1/3/832913-paris-au-fil-de-l-eau-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=01cbfa2e08"},{"name":"Jodie Marsh:  Brawn in the USA","tagline":"","description":"Having proven that she's deadly serious about getting ripped, Jodie Marsh is ready to break the US bodybuilding scene.

As Charles Darwin composed his theory of natural selection, he began defining for the modern generation a suitable, if altogether scientific answer for the origin of man. While this theory has gone largely unchallenged scientifically for the past 150 years, there is one segment of society that has been consistently uncomfortable with its revelations--the community of faith. Does the Bible provide a narrative of mankind's material origins? What is the real source of the controversy surrounding evolution vs. creation? How do we reconcile scientific discovery with a loving, universal, Creator-God? In From the Dust, renowned theologians, educators, and scientists reexamine this perennial debate, and infuse it with fresh theories, new theological insights, and an open desire for truth and dialogue.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/2/9/5/7/5/1129575-from-the-dust-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=2a6fa948b9"},{"name":"3D Bikini Beach Babes Issue #5","tagline":"","description":"Unknown Plot","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"IN","tagline":"","description":"Memories of the year 1997.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"3D Bikini Beach Babes #3","tagline":"","description":"Unknown Plot","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"3D Bikini Beach Babes Issue #4","tagline":"","description":"Plot unknown","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Live At The Moody Theater","tagline":"","description":"A stunning live concert, recorded last November at the Moody Theatre in Austin, TX, captured in dazzling High Definition state-of-the-art video and 5.1 audio.
