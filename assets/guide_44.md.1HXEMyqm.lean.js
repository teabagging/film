Alternating between film and video, Kuntzel and Grandrieux explore physical and psychical perception, constructing an analogy between the way video transforms conventional filmic representation and the way Cubism fractured the perspectival codes of classical pictorial space. Shifting between abstraction and materiality, the real and the imaginary, this work suggests passages between painting, cinema and video.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/6/6/7/4/1/566741-la-peinture-cubiste-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=a35b241e2a"},{"name":"Jamaican Gold","tagline":"Action and romance in the Caribbean.","description":"A chance meeting leads two former college friends into a search for sunken treasure, a search which involves them with the double dealing Landers, supporter of their expedition treasures is discovered, but Landers traps them in an underwater cave.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/9/0/1/7/8/490178-jamaican-gold-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=f375ffa376"},{"name":"Trolltider","tagline":"","description":"Under the stairs to the human beings house lives V?tten.

JEKYLL AND MISS OSBOURNE. Utilising the materials of the complete, restored version of the film, and its French language soundtrack, the film offers a new way of looking at, understanding and appreciating Borowczyk's intensely cinematic art. Particular attention is paid to a painting by Vermeer of a pregnant woman, introduced early into Borowczyk's film, and reappearing at key moments. Beginning from this painting - its content, style, and historical background - particular aspects of the film are explored: its unusual pictorial compositions; the mingling of sexuality with violence; and the association of men and women with (respectively) open and closed spaces. The film argues that Borowczyk brings a surrealist sensibility to his free adaptation of the Jekyll and Hyde story, especially emphasizing the transgressive, revolutionary role of the free-spirited Lucy Osbourne.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/9/0/7/8/5/390785-phantasmagoria-of-the-interior-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=a61a4731e2"},{"name":"Vagabond","tagline":"","description":"A hand drawn animation short about a man struggling to save his dog in a futuristic metropolis.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/5/4/5/1/4/254514-vagabond-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=7c52372252"},{"name":"ST: Aka to Shiro no S?sa File the Movie","tagline":"","description":"The ST team at the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department consists of eccentric members.
