Science, based on scepticism, investigation and evidence, must continuously test its own concepts and claims. Faith, by definition, defies evidence: it is untested and unshakeable, and is therefore in direct contradiction with science.  In addition, though religions preach morality, peace and hope, in fact, says Dawkins, they bring intolerance, violence and destruction.

So, he stays and finds he likes hearing \\"Thank you mask man.\\" When their attention starts to shift elsewhere, he shocks and disgusts the townspeople with a final request.  According to the cartoons producer John Magnuson, at early showings of this, gay audiences were upset by its apparent fag-bashing. And its true, part of the fun of the piece is just crying out Masked mans a fag, scandalising and defacing the image of this all-American hero. But its within the larger context of Bruces analysis of heroism, and that the towns people reject the Masked Man is because of their prejudices, not because Bruce is asking us to endorse them.

How do the locals survive in this low-cost tourist paradise?","description":"At the height of the summer tourist season, the Spanish beach town Magaluf turns into a hellscape of the low-cost travel industry. For eight weeks every year, over one million mostly British vacationers ride an alcohol-soaked tide of public urination, fisticuffs and ambulance sirens for recreation. Instead of assembling a clip-reel of \\"balconing,\\" when drunk idiots jump into hotel pools from their balconies, filmmaker Miguel ngel Blanca crafts a far deeper and atmospheric look at a place where visitors and locals alike are driven by pleasure. Long-time resident Maria has little time left, so she takes in a seasonal lodger who listens to her relive her glory days. An enterprising real estate agent peddles an extravagant development, while a young gay man drifts without any plans beyond robbing a tourist for kicks. Part ghost story, part foreboding parable, this is a stylish and vivid impression of people and a place dreaming of escape.
