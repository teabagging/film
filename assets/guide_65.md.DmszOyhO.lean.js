The process is democratic-but it works in stages, and through the states. This design forces candidates to reach out across the country rather than focusing on just one region or group of population centers. And it keeps presidents from controlling elections-including their own reelections. Publisher and former presidential candidate Steve Forbes, Princeton historian Allen Guelzo, and a host of experts explain why we really have the Electoral College, what it does, and what could happen if we got rid of it.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/6/7/4/8/6/667486-safeguard-an-electoral-college-story-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=f16f17c8cf"},{"name":"Harm Wrestling","tagline":"","description":"No one messes with arm-wrestling champ Yosemite Sam - until Bugs Bunny comes along.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/8/1/9/2/2/881922-harm-wrestling-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=ca13685084"},{"name":"Bombshells and Dollies","tagline":"","description":"Female Empowerment Documentary on the Contemporary Pinup Lifestyle & The Miss Viva Las Vegas Pinup Contest - 'Celebrating every woman's right to total body acceptance, to be self-confident and to be gorgeous!'","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/2/3/6/9/8/523698-bombshells-and-dollies-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=27c94e555b"},{"name":"The Hall","tagline":"\\"ABSTRACT\\" AND \\"SILLY\\" WILL BECOME SYNONYMS ONCE YOU'RE DONE WITH THIS!","description":"An unnamed protagonist attempts to leave the room where they've been working for months and discovers an endless maze of halls.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/1/0/1/0/8/610108-the-hall-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=fbb98bb573"},{"name":"Spoon","tagline":"","description":"In the city, a business man walks to work on a Monday morning when he's interrupted by a junkie-like kid who asks him: Do you want some soup?","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/6/1/2/0/3/661203-spoon-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=5e133c60da"},{"name":"They Say I'm Your Teacher","tagline":"","description":"Created from the 16mm archive of the groundbreaking \\"You Got to Move\\" (a 1985 film about educating activists in the civil rights and labor movements at the legendary Highlander Center), \\"They Say I'm Your Teacher\\" focuses on another agent of change, Bernice Robinson.

As full of sudden reversals as any thriller, this documentary follows Sanjay Dutt as he makes Shootout In Lokhandwala, his last film before being sentenced. He plays a real-life Mumbai police officer, AA Khan, who became a local hero after a fatal shootout with criminals in which 1,400 rounds of ammunition were fired.
