The story of the weekend is told through the eyes of six different people, each a representative of the sorts that the Chiller-Con attracts: Gunnar Hansen, the original man behind the mask; Tiffany Shepis, a scream queen on the rise; Bob Gonzo, a \\"micro-budget\\" filmmaker; two rabid fans; and one of the key men who helps run the convention. Six different people, six different perspectives, one crazy weekend. It certainly promises to be UnConventional.

Fedorov was one of the Cosmo-Immortalists, a surge of thinkers that emerged in Russia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. They linked Western Enlightenment with Russian Orthodoxy and Eastern philosophical traditions, as well as Marxism, to create an idiosyncratically concrete metaphysics. For the Russian cosmists, cosmos did not mean outer space: rather, they wanted to create cosmos on earth. To construct a new reality, free of hunger, disease, violence, death, need, inequality C like communism.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/0/8/1/0/8/308108-this-is-cosmos-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=c1a379a5e3"},{"name":"My Girlfriend Candice","tagline":"A Love Story","description":"A movie about Casey's girlfriend, Candice.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/0/3/5/7/7/503577-my-girlfriend-candice-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=5670887192"},{"name":"Kuro","tagline":"","description":"Three young people in Tokyo.

Drawn frame by frame on the 35mm film stock of a 70s pornographic film, the sexual content is partially revealed and partially hidden by black animated forms that seem to be fugitive memories of an old love. The music is slow and harrowing like a howl for love.  The artist works with marker as one might use a stencil, revealing part of the original film in the drawing's negative space. By combining pornographic and sentimental expression, the film posits that emotional misery is also physical. Sexual excitation and heartache are both based on an alternation of empty and full, presence and absence, hidden and revealed things. This manipulated film creates ambiguous images where scopophilia is no longer based on tactile frustration.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/2/9/1/3/8/429138-deep-inside-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=4f075bf9c5"},{"name":"Cecil B.
