This entailed shipping over scores of indignes and forcing them to act out the gestures of their everyday lives under the eyes of 1930s Parisian society. A slightly less elaborate, although equally controversial at the time, visual representation of The Other was one of the first film documentaries to be made which sought to represent the lives of a colonised people, Marc Allgrets Voyage au Congo.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/8/0/7/7/7/180777-voyage-au-congo-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=8ec6e6aa3a"},{"name":"Bud's Recruit","tagline":"","description":"This WWI home-front comedy is the earliest surviving film of King Vidor, who would later go on to make such classics as The Big Parade and The Crowd.
