In addressing these questions we are taken into the back drop of the history of Germany beginning in the late 1800s through the late 20th Century at the eve of the 21st.  A society that does not take archetypes, myths, and symbols seriously will possibly be jumped by them from behind.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/3/9/5/2/2/139522-black-sun-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=9595219f6b"},{"name":"Matt","tagline":"","description":"\\"Five years after the making of the video portrait Boys in the Backyard, the film maker returns to San Francisco to see what has become of Matt.

Pasolini was best known to Americans for his film The Gospel According to St. Matthew. However, in his native Italy, he was at least as well known for his writing and poetry as for his filmmaking. In the first episode, Pasolini (Marco Cavicchioli) waxes poetic about the beauty of young men during a visit to Sicily. The second and more interesting segment concerns a meeting with a young man who visits Pasolini thinking that though he is an old has-been, Pasolini may be able to do him a favor. Pasolini twigs to the boy's intentions, and a sparring session ensues. The final episode shows him picking up a young man at Rome's train station and the events that led to his beating death in 1975.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/0/3/1/2/6/203126-nerolio-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=2a3128d59a"},{"name":"Girls Still Dream","tagline":"","description":"a documentary about girls and education in the traditional rural societies of Egypt. by the late Atiyat Al-Abnoudi sheds light on the conditions of Egyptian girls in rural areas in Egypt in the year 1995.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/7/1/3/1/6/671316-girls-still-dream-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=b5ca7b15ac"},{"name":"Tales Till the End","tagline":"","description":"Three friends, sealed up in an underground bunker while the world ends, tell stories to pass the time.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/3/5/7/2/3/335723-tales-till-the-end-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=f306b99d74"},{"name":"Soul Survivor","tagline":"In this world you always have to pay.","description":"A young black man takes a job as a debt collector in Toronto's Jamaican community.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/1/9/9/5/9/319959-soul-survivor-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=66f5758e19"},{"name":"Santa's Christmas Snooze","tagline":"","description":"A grouchy bear doses Santa Claus with a sleeping potion in order to ruin Christmas in this animated feature.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/2/1/0/7/2/421072-santa-s-christmas-snooze-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=3ba433a843"},{"name":"Open Season","tagline":"","description":"When the television ratings machines suddenly malfunction, public television suddenly, but mistakenly, soars to #1 in this humorous satire.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/4/5/4/1/2/145412-open-season-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=78b6b45d12"},{"name":"Final Exit","tagline":"","description":"A Nobel Peace Prize winner, a convicted murderer and two professing Christian teenagers are being escorted to judgment.

It recounts the history of the Second World War from a Japanese perspective, combining original colour film with letters and diaries written by Japanese people. It tells the story of a nation at war from the diverse perspectives of those who lived through it: the leaders and the ordinary people, the oppressors and the victims, the guilty and the innocent.  Until recently, it was believed that no colour film of Japan existed prior to 1945. But specialist research has now unearthed a remarkable colour record from as early as the 1930s.  For eight years the Japanese fought what they believed was a Holy War that became a fight to the death. Japan's War In Colour shows how militarism took hold of the Japanese people; describes why Japan felt compelled to attack the West; explains what drove the Japanese to resist the Allies for so long; and, finally, reveals how they dealt with the shame of defeat.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/0/6/0/4/40604-japan-s-war-in-colour-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=558a0aeab0"},{"name":"Dead End Road","tagline":"","description":"Detective Burt Williams has been on the trail of the infamous \\"Poe killer\\" for nearly three years.

He was a charming, clever Etonian, with powerful friends everywhere. And lovers too - at a time when homosexuality was illegal, Burgess made no secret of his sexual tastes. He turned out to be the most flamboyant of a ring of privileged Cambridge students who had secretly joined the Communists in the 1930s, disgusted by their own government's policy of appeasing Hitler.
