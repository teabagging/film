The text for this film, Summer Days in Keijowritten in 1937 (2007), is inspired by two minor chapters about the city Keijo (out of a total of 34 eloquent chapters on \\"Korean wilds and villages\\"). Keijo is the Japanese pronunciation of the old word for Seoul, known as Kyungsung to many contemporary Koreans. The city, since 1937, has repeatedly been revamped, relocated, displaced, demolished, or destroyed by the capricious needs of the ever-sliding bar of present times.

With extraordinary plain-spoken candor, the Ames family reveals how callous parenting and diverging religious views may have led an entire generation to turn away from the family tradition.

Finally, the Soviet people's yearning for a freer society leads to accelerating reforms and the ultimate dissolution of the USSR.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/4/7/3/5/4/1047354-soviet-union-the-rise-and-fall-part-1-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=abc4e3c52f"},{"name":"Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Brute Man","tagline":"","description":"Mike and the robots are subjected to a horrible creeper movie for their experiment preceded by a short about chicken farming.
