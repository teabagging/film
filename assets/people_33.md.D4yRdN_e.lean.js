LES TROYENS ('The Trojans') is a tour de force of music that ranges from fiery military marches to intense choruses, passionate soliloquies C such as those of the prophetess Cassandre C and the lyrical love duets of Didon and ne. It is Hector Berlioz's largest work and he wrote the libretto himself, drawing upon his intimate knowledge of Virgil's Aeneid. To the composer's disappointment, LES TROYENS was only performed once in full during his lifetime and was often presented in shortened form during the 20th century. The Royal Opera's production provides a rare chance to see this epic work in its entirety. David McVicar's staging is on an enormous scale, assembling one of the largest casts ever seen at Covent Garden.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/1/5/9/3/5/315935-les-troyens-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=0351a5520e"},{"name":"Retreat!","tagline":"","description":"Inspired by war films from the 1950's, Retreat! tells the story of nine U.S. Soldiers who were forced to retreat into unknown territories deep in the heart of Korea.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/1/4/7/3/9/314739-retreat--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=88709285e4"},{"name":"Magnus Betnr IV","tagline":"Stand-up","description":"16 days ago, i was on stage at a sold out Chinateatern, recording this special.
