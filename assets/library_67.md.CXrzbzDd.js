And it ends with \\"Can't Get Enough\\", which they couldn't rouse themselves to turn up for, instead allowing the song to soundtrack a short, though undeniably amusing, film about revenge. In between the quality varies with Suede's enthusiasm. Some of the videos here are every bit as awful as the band think, especially the altogether bewildering \\"Stay Together\\". Others they should give themselves more credit for \\"The Wild Ones\\", for example, retains a haunting quality that was worth any amount of plodding around a freezing Dartmoor.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/2/5/4/5/62545-suede-lost-in-tv-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=151c23a812"},{"name":"Mi crimen al desnudo","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/4/6/7/5/5/846755-mi-crimen-al-desnudo-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=ef950435c1"},{"name":"Full Frontal","tagline":"","description":"Mock documentary on the adult film world.

Violent bandit and cattle rustler Pancho, his rude henchman Santas and a group of raiders have sworn to drive the settlers out of the Border country. In the conflict that follows, Harry's father Bill is mortally wounded, and Pancho's hands are crushed, supposedly by the ranchers, though the act is actually committed by his traitorous and vengeful lieutenant Santas and his equally slimy compatriot Rodriguez, whom Pancho has offended by denying one his daughter's hand, and the other permission to pursue Rancher's daughter Ruth Chadwick. Pancho swears bitter revenge on the Burrels and the two factions resolve to destroy each other.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/0/5/5/2/4/305524-the-masked-rider-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=eb26ad1f81"},{"name":"Yotsuya Kaidan (Jitsoroku Oiwa)","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"The Great Problem","tagline":"","description":"A young pickpocket is taken in by an attorney who attempts to 'civilize' her.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/2/7/8/8/2/527882-the-great-problem-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=214adf6011"},{"name":"Dreamy Dud Sees Charlie Chaplin","tagline":"","description":"Dreamy Dud and his dog, Wag, are down-hearted because they haven't the money to go into a picture theater and see a Chaplin picture.

For all three, the production marked their main-stage debut at the Royal Opera House.  The tale, inspired by a medieval legend, tells of an ill-fated troubadour, drawn into a liaison with an innocent maiden. But they are observed by the jealous eye of her protector, who wreaks a shocking revenge on the young couple.

Germany, 19th century, Middle Rhein Valley. The dreamy Idilia awakes injured in the midst of a gloomy castle ruin and can't remember anything that happened before. When she discovers in horror that there is no escaping the towering castle walls, she begins a grueling fight for survival. Only her nebulous diary can help her decipher the past, which exposes a secret romance with Abyssinian actor Caven, a performer in a human zoo exhibition run by her fiancee Franz Hagerberg. Idilia's written record, however, blurs the lines between reality and fiction.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/6/0/7/1/2/860712-4-tage-bis-zur-ewigkeit-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=7bdfdd4afd"},{"name":"CIRCUS","tagline":"I'll just have to gamble!","description":"A man facing financial struggles decides to gamble away his life's savings in a game of \\"Snakes and Ladders\\".","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/9/1/2/2/3/991223-circus-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=cbf594b522"},{"name":"Respirations","tagline":"","description":"In a burning world, wrecked by pollution, a survivor is heading towards his final destination.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/7/5/7/1/9/975719-respirations-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=1e7c013e37"},{"name":"Eternamente Adolescente","tagline":"","description":"An actor who was famous and successful when he was just a 15-year-old teenager starring in the movie \\"The Pool Cleaner.\\" Today, he finds himself without a job, without money and without friends, still living in his parents' house.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/7/9/5/0/1/979501-eternamente-adolescente-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=314e98e0aa"},{"name":"Lass","tagline":"","description":"Jan works at her father's old fashioned clothing shop but her life is about to change when singer Helen comes in to buy a suit.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/7/3/5/2/6/973526-lass-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=9c70e4229a"},{"name":"Lendemain","tagline":"","description":"A filmmaker at a crossroads in his life, travels to the campsite where he fell in love for the first time.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/5/3/5/3/0/953530-lendemain-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=3fdd1be6c7"},{"name":"La fin du genre?","tagline":"","description":"A documentary built on the mode of the crossed portrait in which we immerse ourselves in the daily life of 4 non-binary people: Ange, Sophie, Persphone and Lou.
