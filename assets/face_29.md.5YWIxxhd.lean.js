The work was created during Whitebreads self-initiated residency on the Marsh, a place that she often returns to in her work both physically and mentally. Heavily influenced by Derek Jarmans writings on gardening, Whitebread tries to open up a wider discourse on our role as humans on planet Earth. The film is an experimental video focused on unhinging our commonplace connections between language, images and perceptions of nature by exploring her own sensual and somatic feelings towards the Marsh, experiencing the geography as an important site of creative and ecological insight. Using photograms as a tool enables the artist to play with slow/non-human time and to imagine her own ecological existence.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/9/6/0/1/6/696016-with-silver-bells-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=e702c28553"},{"name":"K?v","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/6/8/7/6/8/1068768-kv-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=fc901b9cf9"},{"name":"N?in tehtiin Poissa","tagline":"","description":"Documentary film about the making of Arttu Haglund's feature film Gone.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/4/1/7/1/9/1141719-nain-tehtiin-poissa-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=1189358590"},{"name":"Sister Dynamite","tagline":"","description":"Don't mess with HER.
