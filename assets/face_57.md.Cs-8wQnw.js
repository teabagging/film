Women must all cover up in public. Women cannot drive nor can they travel without the permission of a man. Women are restricted in work, and study, and social activities.

The New York Times' Mona El-Naggar takes us inside the kingdom and introduces us to three proud and dynamic women, each determined to test the bounds of her society in different ways. The setting is a city council election in Riyadh, where in 2015 Saudi women were allowed to vote and run for office for the first time. While they could finally participate, though, they could not actually campaign in public. Ladies First offers a riveting and intimate view of the complex and largely inaccessible world of Saudi women, chronicling this remarkable first effort of women to claim a place on the political stage of their nation","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Milk Men","tagline":"The Life and Times of Dairy Farmers","description":"As the global economics of dairy farming has winnowed out most small and medium-sized dairies, the surviving farmers confront pressures to intensify production, even as they find that getting bigger presents new problems.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/3/0/8/7/3/1030873-milk-men-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=f54d942b87"},{"name":"Warm Silence","tagline":"","description":"A guy decides to take a break from everyone and leaves for a country house together with his beloved dog.

In his modern staging, producer David Alden has resorted to all kinds of magic tricks. The mourning Almirena, for example, is suspended like a paralysed mermaid in a neon-blue water tank for her aria Lascia ch'io pianga. Armida constantly struggles to make her obstinate pet Hydra see reason, and no expense is spared on the stylishly artistic dance interludes. The characters move in an ironic blend of Twenties look, trendy club scene and sacro' kitsch. Unsurprisingly, opera-goers were quick to latch onto such a glittering and star studded production. Indeed, there can be no doubt that the American David Daniels is the undisputed star of this Munich production, even alongside the other famous names on the cast list.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/2/0/2/4/1/720241-handel-rinaldo-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=0f55725a16"},{"name":"Connait-on encore Leprest ? - Coffret","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/4/4/5/0/3/444503-connait-on-encore-leprest-coffret-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=102e091171"},{"name":"Paris : Fin du monde","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/4/0/6/2/94062-paris-fin-du-monde-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=097f3fd90f"},{"name":"Piquinu","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/0/7/5/9/9/1007599-piquinu-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=ba155ab67b"},{"name":"TERRA X: BIBELR?TSEL - Teil 2 - Die Macht der Zehn Gebote","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/8/8/2/7/4/288274-terra-x-bibelratsel-teil-2-die-macht-der-zehn-gebote-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=6c0fe6f2cb"},{"name":"Juste le Meilleur des Galas 2012","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/2/0/9/8/112098-juste-le-meilleur-des-galas-2012-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=13579a56c2"},{"name":"Salamandras y Salamandros","tagline":"","description":"The art, as such, is a highly abstract concept as always depends on the sensations of people, feelings and ultimately evokes them whether they like it or not.
