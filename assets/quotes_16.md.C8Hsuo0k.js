His straight talk and colorful language have led some to call him the Mormon Mark Twain or Will Rogers. Drawing heavily from the diaries, letters, and speeches of J. Golden Kimball, James Arrington has created a masterful look into the life of this unique LDS leader who has inspired (and entertained) countless Saints throughout the years. J. Golden built faith and hope in the early Saints as he taught them that if he could make it, there was a chance for anybody! As he once stated, \\"I may not have walked the straight and narrow, but I crossed it as often as I could!\\" The legendary wit, humor, and warmth of J.

The protagonist begins her journey in an abstract light-world, and moves to a dystopian realm filled with haunting images of outbreak and quarantine, before ending up in an emotional and intense one-take love story that takes a turn for the worse.

Controlled by the US Bureau of Reclamation, the Rio Grande river is fractured by over-appropriated irrigation systems supplying New Mexico and Texas. For the majority of the year, for a time period that continues to grow, the river runs dry starting from someplace below Elephant Butte Dam to around Ojinaga where it is reformed by other source rivers. Upstream (into America) reduces the Rio Grande to its essence, waterand thereby, the absence of water. As the images shift from sand to water, they seem to hold aspirations of resources, abundance, and life, but depict the actuality of corporate exploitation, hoarding, and environmental crisis.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/1/6/1/1/8/1016118-upstream-into-america--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=3b357dc605"},{"name":"Caf au Fate","tagline":"","description":"Lydia Alucardi is a socially mute goth girl who wants nothing more than to speak to people without worry.

Given the number of protagonists, it is also the story of a tragedy.  Only 14 years after the premiere of Hernani, Giuseppe Verdi adapted Victor Hugos play into an opera to premiere at La Fenice, Venice in 1844. Ernani was an immediate and lasting triumph for the young Verdi, marking his prowess at adapting an historical event (the crowning of Charles V as emperor at Aachen Cathedral) to a psychologically convincing musical drama. The backdrop of three men paying court to one woman was the perfect foil for Verdi to explore the expressive qualities of three types of male voice.

So I tried to keep her at arm's length. But one day Bom licked my empty heart and my defenses melted away.
