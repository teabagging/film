We join the famous long drag at Settle Junction - 15 miles of almost continuous climb up to Blea Moor.  The 24 arch Ribblehead viaduct is seen from the air as well as from the drivers cab. Our sprinter disappears into the long tunnels at Blea Moor and Rise Hill while we fly over the top for a surprising view!

This we know about Boudica, Queen of the Iceni. Her story and her tribe's have been recorded by Roman historians, pondered by scholars, and examined by archaeologists who continue to dig for clues about this warrior whose army set fear in the hearts of Romans. When King Prasutagus died, the Iceni tribe, which once lived in peace with Rome, were brutally set upon by Romans--they beat Queen Boudica and raped her daughters. Seething with revenge, Boudica's forces attacked Roman settlements including London, a thriving Roman merchant center, which was destroyed. Here, we uncover the remarkable story of Boudica, who led her tribe in a revolt never seen before or since in British history. Her struggle--to free Briton's tribes from Roman domination; at stake--the freedom and independence of all Briton's tribes and their unique Celtic culture.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/1/6/8/0/8/1116808-warrior-queen-boudica-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=51fe9b26d3"},{"name":"War Strategy Revealed: Guadalcanal","tagline":"","description":"The first American invasion force of the Second World War gathered off the coast of Guadalcanal.
