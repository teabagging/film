At the center of the Rube GoldbergClike system, an obese woman kneads and directs the dough. When a bouquet of flowers is placed before her, a chain reaction is set off: the flowers produce allergic tears, which fall to the floor and generate steam, which in turn causes the dough to rise before it is finally packaged. Equating industrial and bodily processes, the journey of the fleshy dough alludes to digestion, excretion, and birth. Dough evinces the influence of 1970s feminist body art and also recalls Matthew Barneys elaborate sets and surreal physical processes. Like Barney, Rottenberg gives sculptural form to her videos; here, the projection appears in a cramped wooden room, its outer supports weighed down by doughy sandbags.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/4/7/6/0/5/547605-cheese-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=ad2c4345e4"},{"name":"The Teeth Beneath","tagline":"","description":"A monster it's unleashed in the basement of a skate shop, forcing the shop employees to do battle with the beast, in order to recover their money and their merchandise before they have to open the store at 11am.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/7/2/3/5/9/472359-the-teeth-beneath-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=ad68b56996"},{"name":"Sexual Suspects","tagline":"Lies...Suspicion... & Sexual Intrigue","description":"Lies, suspicion, and intrigue of a uniquely sexual nature envelop a group of hi-tech thieves on the lam in a remote country house.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/4/8/1/3/7/348137-sexual-suspects-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=0328c38444"},{"name":"Bu?uel: Atheist Thanks to God","tagline":"","description":"Documentary featuring interviews with several of legendary Spanish director Luis Bunuels close friends and collaborators.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/8/4/9/3/1/384931-bunuel-atheist-thanks-to-god-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=7f58d817d5"},{"name":"Abducted by the Daleks","tagline":"A drive into the country turns into a terrifying nightmare when four innocent young girls are . . . abducted by the Daleks!","description":"A group of young women gets abducted by the Daleks.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/7/4/1/8/77418-abducted-by-the-daleks-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=f47cf61cf3"},{"name":"Farhan melazem adem","tagline":"","description":"Farhaan Melaazem Adam leaves Upper Egypt to Cairo hoping to find a better life.

But this designation entails its own violence, marginalizing the demands of island residents that it be fully decontaminated and turned over to municipal management. This conflict is the point of departure for Under Discussion. An overturned conference table has been retrofitted with an engine and rubber grafted from a small fishing boat. In liberal thought, the table is a common architectural trope used for symmetrical communication and the non-violent resolution of conflict. Yet it often fails to account for the inequalities that structure spaces of negotiation.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/5/3/8/2/3/453823-under-discussion-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=9eee24abda"},{"name":"Zanzibar","tagline":"","description":"A documentary by Jackie Raynal about the artistic movement Zanzibar.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/1/9/2/5/0/319250-zanzibar-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=6c93bb7548"},{"name":"Reverse of the Curse of the Bambino","tagline":"","description":"This acclaimed documentary combines unforgettable archival footage with contemporary interviews that focus on the true Red Sox fans who have been dreaming of the day they could see the Curse of the Bambino put to rest, once and for all.
