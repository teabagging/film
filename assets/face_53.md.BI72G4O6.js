This concert serves to remind us of the genius with which this pioneering artist almost single-handedly revived the Blues, and how he has made them his own over a phenomenal career in music. Featuring the paired lead guitars of Walter Trout and Coco Montoya, the band rocks hard in a tight groove that enables searing solos from the featured guitarists as well as from Mayall himself on guitar and keyboards. The guttural power of Mayall's vocals is ever-present. And the songs - most of them Mayall originals - include the classic Room To Move, with which John Mayall once electrified the world of Rock 'n' Roll.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/3/2/4/7/4/232474-john-mayall-the-bluesbreakers-live-in-germany-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=91baf8523e"},{"name":"ߧ֧ԧڧߧ ݧէ","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/1/7/9/4/7/617947---0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=9460323a28"},{"name":"Home Front","tagline":"","description":"17 year old Brendan and his friend Mary, campaign against the closure of the residential home for children in which they live.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/2/0/9/6/1/920961-home-front-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=c878eaef5a"},{"name":"Irisan-irisan Hati","tagline":"","description":"Even though he is not a \\"left wing\\" student, Nurhadi, nicknamed Hadi, insists on becoming a volunteer in the fight against Malaysia.
