The subsequent acquittal of the accused in connivance with the state machinery outraged India and galvanized womens activism that led to the Vishaka Guidelines, and subsequently the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace Act in 2013. This documentary juxtaposes the law on paper with the ground realities, through a first-of-its-kind log of stories and experiences of over two dozen Indian women; tales of sexual violence that they face - from opulent corporate offices, to construction sites and manual scavenging - and their fight for justice against an obstinate patriarchal state. But What Was She Wearing? attempts to portray the impotence of this paper-law and the impossible odds Indian women are up against in pursuit of justice.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/1/0/4/4/6/710446-but-what-was-she-wearing--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=8a17723e4e"},{"name":"Lovelyz: Lovelyz in Winterland 2","tagline":"Lovelyz in Winterland 2","description":"Lovelyz in their 2nd Winterland concert","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/2/5/0/4/8/625048-lovelyz-lovelyz-in-winterland-2-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=f42c64a80d"},{"name":"Tears","tagline":"","description":"A poor couple is about to have a plausible date for their 3rd anniversary.

As a Hong-Kong born, Paris-trained artist, Tseng viewed himself as a citizen of the world and eschewed labeling himself or his art as \\"Chinese.\\" However, his ironic self-portraits posed in a Mao suit in front of American landmarks found their way to Communist China and were profoundly influential for China's avant-garde, including conceptual artists Song Dong and Zhang Huan, who were exposed to Tseng's images through western magazines smuggled into the country in the 1980's. Tseng's photographs not only satirized relations between the United States and its emerging rival, China, but also broadcasted his freedom of movement - a privilege denied most Chinese artists at the time.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/4/0/7/2/0/540720-east-meets-west-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=bf5a9412e5"},{"name":"Housecats","tagline":"","description":"A comedic battle between two house cats, Squeak and Scratch.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/9/7/4/5/7/697457-housecats-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=f6f53a1fc9"},{"name":"פȮ","tagline":"","description":"This film features \\"Shi-chan\\", a dog kept by the Hirano family.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/9/3/7/7/3/893773--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=e985f80fff"},{"name":"Don Carlo","tagline":"A very good, complete production of Don Carlos","description":"Ghiaurov, Freni, and Bumbry were great voices in their time, and they are still effective here -- good enough musicians to put over the quite heavy vocal and expressive demands of their roles.

Placido Domingo recorded his first Don Carlo, for EMI with Giulini, about 15 years before this production, but he looks and sounds fine here -- in the early 1980's he was doing very good Otellos and Lohengrins too, and Furlanetto, still in his 30's, brings a rich, young voice to an old part and succeeds in making the Grand Inquisitor vocally as well as expressively formidable.
