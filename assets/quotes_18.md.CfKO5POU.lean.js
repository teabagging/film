JJ Stratfords formal exploration of the LZX Video Synthesizer and the Fairlight Computer Video Instrument (CVI) resulted in a suite of 10 short experimental videos questioning obsolescence and early video aesthetics. At first glance, one could mistakenly take this work to be a study of dead-media fetishism. However, one watches this suite unfold into a delicate investigation of the limits of technology, and the potential those limits enable. Through the use of preset wipes and crude RGB color palettes, Stratford uncovers hidden potential in what otherwise would be considered a long-outmoded device for creative expression. In doing so, the typical subversive gesture of using obsolete technology that occurs within contemporary art is supplanted by an earnest exploration into a crucial link between early video aesthetics and current technologically inflected imagery.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Mantra","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/6/3/9/1/5/763915-mantra-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=c01db7a760"},{"name":"Circuit","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/4/6/2/4/1/546241-circuit-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=af70a52e24"},{"name":"What I Did in Fifth Grade","tagline":"","description":"A teacher chronicles his final year working in a school with a large underprivileged population.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/1/7/6/8/5/817685-what-i-did-in-fifth-grade-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=d6c113e401"},{"name":"This Is Exile: Diaries of Child Refugees","tagline":"","description":"'This is Exile' is an extraordinary, intimate portrait of child refugees forced to flee from the violence of Syria's civil war to neighbouring Lebanon.

Using direct observation he was able to determine the presence of a microorganism in cancerous tumors. This discovery led to the development of a cure for cancer and most infectious diseases with a device that could destroy any viral or bacterial microorganism with electrical pulses tuned to a specific frequency. This is where Royal Rife's story takes a tragic turn. A drugless cure for such devastating diseases was an anathema for the monopolistic nature of the medical establishment in America during that time. The FDA considered experiments with his frequency device to be a crime and in 1946 Rife was forced to close his lab. Over 70 years later, people are attempting to recreate Rife's lost discoveries and piece together the technology that promised miraculous cures.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/3/3/1/3/2/233132-the-rise-and-fall-of-a-scientific-genius-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=debf3a38f8"},{"name":"Toque Profundo: Sesin 25","tagline":"","description":"Legendary Dominican rock band Toque Profundo deliver their hits.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/9/3/4/4/4/293444-toque-profundo-sesion-25-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=81d52440a8"},{"name":"Horst Janssen - Ich bin die Gnade Gottes","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/4/1/4/3/4/341434-horst-janssen-ich-bin-die-gnade-gottes-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=43597a1cbb"},{"name":"Pinhead In Fantasia","tagline":"","description":"Companion DVD to Fourth World Magazine Vol. II by Spencer Clark of The Skaters.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/1/0/4/2/6/710426-pinhead-in-fantasia-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=e4e3b6925b"},{"name":"Carry the Tune","tagline":"","description":"Students discover musical opportunities outside of high school, and use it to find a sense of balance in their lives.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Lads: The Sickest Doco","tagline":"The Sickest","description":"A documentary presenter is lead by a group of Australian lads throughout their neighborhood to show the lives of these 'gangster' individuals.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/7/6/3/3/8/276338-lads-the-sickest-doco-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=71851689a1"},{"name":"Mammoth Unearthed","tagline":"","description":"The discovery of woolly mammoth remains raises important questions.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/9/8/4/2/8/798428-mammoth-unearthed-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=f0720d5c0a"},{"name":"Sub Rosa","tagline":"","description":"A five-person family live under the rules of a cult-like religious parish.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/5/5/1/7/6/755176-sub-rosa-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=335d0781de"},{"name":"Love Bomb","tagline":"A Journey From Fear To Love","description":"After quitting her job at the World Trade Center Rhea Zimmerman finds herself 9 months later, in New York City on 9/11, feeling afraid, horrified, lost and wondering what she could do to help create a better story for humanity.

Set against stunning vistas of the rugged terrain, the film captures not only the music, but the richly textured details of daily life - hospitality customs, food preparation, games, caring for the herds. It is a portrait of a people who live almost entirely off their animals - horses, yaks, camels, and sheep - with little contact with the outside world.Travelling by horseback, truck and foot, Desjacques tracks down the most revered diphonic musicians. The diphonic sound combines a base drone with a melodic upper register.

The fervent prayers of the actors are undermined by indifference, forgetfulness, and the presence of the camera.
