The combination of separate still photography creates an intense and isolated look at these harsh textures frame by frame. The continuity harnessed ends up with a disjointed and off-beat sense of movement across it. One could think of a stretch of road as a reel of film, yet the frames of road presented here were not composed to merely move in one smooth direction.
