The greatest legends of jazz, from Louis Armstrong to the cool Miles Davis, are caught in some of their most passionate or private moments. Epitomizing the spirit of 1960s counter-culture, a hippie plays a flute as he walks along, all his earthly belongings in a back-pack. Lost in her own thoughts for a moment, Audrey Hepburn sits pensive between takes.  Images capture the subdued beauty of a Provence winter. Like an abstract painting, the sun appears as a point of light behind a window coated thickly with frost. Modern architecture captured as an almost sci-fi fantasy - an environment so artificial that it is sublimely beautiful. All of these images came from the eye, mind and camera of Dennis Stock (1928-2010), one of the most influential chroniclers of the late 20th century.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/7/5/3/0/6/375306-beyond-iconic-photographer-dennis-stock-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=406e58f13e"},{"name":"Ausgerechnet Sex!","tagline":"","description":"Housewife Marie is surprised by the tragic death of her husband.

Weisman Museum in Minneapolis, as well as his first European commission, the EMR Communication and Technology Center in Bad Oeynhausen, Germany. Seeing himself as an artist first, Gehry discusses his early relationships in the art world and how sculpture, painting and small scale work has influenced his architectural style. Like Rauschenberg, Johns, and Warhol, he has introduced \\"bad taste\\" into his concepts, while keeping himself outside of the contemporary dialogue between modernism and post-modernism.

Four characters dare to speak out publicly for the first time to recount the solidarity and support they found in this very special environment that has welcomed them: the Celtic circles. It's the story of a paradox, further proof that nothing is ever black and white. In Brittany's Celtic circles, with their outdated, conservative image of a fantasized society, homosexual men have for decades found a place of acceptance and tolerance. This is Gildas Sergent's milieu. Choreographer, sailor-cook who shares his cultural, social and jovial universe, and goes to meet these men who have dared to assert their singularity. They did so thanks to the tolerance they found in these folk groups. For many, sexual identity is no longer a taboo, or a source of shame. They can be role models, thinkers who make us reconsider our certainties and convictions.

While Argentina suffered 649 casualties during the War, subsequently over 350 ex-servicemen have committed suicide while attempting to come to terms with civilian life in the aftermath of the 1982 defeat. Longo's film is structured around an extended interview with War veteran Sergio Delgado who provides a moving testimony on the conflict and the ways in which it has subsequently haunted his life and aspirations. As much an insider's view of the conflict as a tale of the legacy of trauma, Not Really Ours offers a reflection on memory, fear and the shaping of a nation's psyche. Longo's deft editing juxtaposes telling footage alongside Delgado's story. The result is both a moving tapestry of war and its scars and a telling reflection on the ways in which official history is constructed.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/4/3/0/3/0/343030-no-tan-nuestras-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=bf24d9a1b0"},{"name":"Kings of the Road","tagline":"","description":"A documentary about Gus Van Sant's cultural influences during the making 'My Own Private Idaho' with a knowing introduction of the finished film's legacy.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"The Superdry Films","tagline":"","description":"A Japanese Anthology","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/3/7/3/3/4/837334-the-superdry-films-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=43fce7b380"},{"name":"Devotion","tagline":"","description":"Filled with despair by the loss of her mother in a car accident, eleven-year-old bi-racial Alice finds it hard to accept that her father Grant wants to start a new life.

Generally, even in politically engaged documentaries or those with a specific point to make, the image (which is to say, the uniquely cinematic element) effectively constitutes the primary material of the film () with Marker it works quite differently. I would say that the primary material is intelligence, that its immediate means of expression is language, and that the image only intervenes in the third position, in reference to this verbal intelligence. In 2017, the intelligence in his essay films still flows in the fringes of filmmaking.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Why did I write the Bible","tagline":"","description":"Francis, a man in his sixties, is found in a diving suit, swimming in a river in the city center.
