My family and I live in Ayase, and I work at a bookstore in Ikebukuro. Sometimes I open a store at a flea market with a friend. We sell tableware, which she likes, and accessories made from buttons, which I make, and they are quite popular. With the money we saved there, my friend went on a long-awaited trip abroad. My goal is to start living alone. Today is my day off, so I go out to check out an apartment. I stopped by a park and saw cats having a meeting. When I saw the old building, I suddenly wanted to see my grandmother, so I took the train...  The entire film is written in monologue and with a handheld 8mm camera, and features all the things \\"I\\" like: buttons, the dawn from my room, cats, the ocean, and my grandmother. There is no context, no meaning, no great sense of beauty, but they play a comfortable rhythm and a beautiful melody. This is a fictional essay whose natural gentleness reminds us of non-fiction.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/3/5/6/5/3/835653-scent-of-the-sun-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=945d5be73c"},{"name":"Signal Left, Turn Right","tagline":"","description":"Journalist Gou Yujia (played by Niu Zhenhua), laid-off female worker Cheng Fen (played by Ding Jiali), individual business owner Lv Dou (played by Wang Jinsong), and wealthy man Lao Cha (played by Ju Hao) are members of Class 1025 at the driving school, practicing under the guidance of Coach Hou, a retired soldier.

Floods caused by the Ethiopian rains spread the silt and evacuated the algae. The order of nature was disrupted, the salt rose and cracked the earth, the crops burned. Sea water reached the water tables. The Nubians fled the valley engulfed by the waters, leaving behind their villages and their culture. Twenty-five years after the construction of the dam, there is no longer any coherence between the lower valley and the Nile.
