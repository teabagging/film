He became the subject of this post-documentary film (one that is beyond the feature/documentary division), around which its director Tamir Zadok, who also appears in \\"Art Undercover\\", created an entire exhibition in the Tel Aviv Museum of Art in 2018. Tamir travels to Cairo in order to find Charduvals paintings that were sold to the Museum of Modern Egyptian Art, while also trying not to give his identity away. This way Zadok is also creating art undercover, brilliantly carrying on the tradition of artistic espionage, alternating documentary episodes with scenes that but imitate real-life footage. The film becomes a match to the subject it explores.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"In the Arms of Morpheus","tagline":"They said I was going to Hell, so I figured I might as well be the devil herself.","description":"A short film about living on the fringe.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/2/6/2/4/1/1026241-in-the-arms-of-morpheus-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=3f49b6a4d3"},{"name":"Distorted","tagline":"","description":"Nouveau African-American drama short in Atlanta for BET.Two sisters meet to put their father to rest when they get an unexpected knock at the door, turning their night upside down.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/8/6/6/6/3/786663-distorted-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=eb7bf17551"},{"name":"School For Passionate Girls","tagline":"","description":"School For Passionate Girls","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/4/1/2/6/0/641260-school-for-passionate-girls-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=137b2f997e"},{"name":"Die Schlachtfelder der Zukunft","tagline":"","description":"Germany, 2030: Former war journalist Lea breaks into the compound of a war drone CEO.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Take the Hill","tagline":"","description":"Dick Grace is a man of intriguing contractions.

It tells the story of the impossible union of poet Werther to Charlotte, a woman of duty already promised to a wealthy businessman. Goethes drama is echoed in Massenets score by emotionally wide-ranging vocal parts written on a grand scale. Juan Diego Flrez is undisputedly one of the best belcanto tenors of our times and embodies a tortured and nuanced Werther. 'Its not a profane appearance of any singer it is an epiphany!' gushes the Neue Zrcher Zeitung in a rave review. At Flrezs side, Franco-British mezzo-soprano Anna Stphany sang her role dbut as Charlotte. The one-room staging by Tatjana Grbaca cleverly makes the social stranglehold of oppression tangible.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/6/4/4/4/8/664448-massenet-werther-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=1c87d6ed48"},{"name":"I Must Find You","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/9/7/6/9/1/797691--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=039d4b1800"},{"name":"Our Dream Era","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/0/2/5/7/9/802579--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=ea70f20eb7"},{"name":"Halfway","tagline":"","description":"In the middle of the night, Ka Fu drives his brother in law to the hospital.

But the director forgets the fact that in recent times we have seen a number of film revolving such issue. There are strong traces of Balaji Sakthivel's Kadhal in this flick. Story and the screenplay seems to be the main culprit here which ends with an illogical climax. J.K. Venky's camera works is good so is Fen Viallee's music scores.

THE NEW GREEN GIANTS looks at a number of these new and old organic corporations and shows how they are managing, or in some cases, failing to live up to the idealistic dreams first espoused by the back-to-the land folk of the late sixties and early seventies. The documentary also looks at some of the bigger questions surrounding organic food. Is it really healthier? Is it truly organic? Is it possible to grow from a mom-and-pop operation to become a huge supplier of major grocery chains? Is it actually sustainable? Is it realistic to think the world can be fed organically?","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Animelo Summer Live 2011 -rainbow- 8.28","tagline":"","description":"Animelo Summer Live 2011 -rainbow- took place at Saitama Arena over two days on August 27 and August. 28.

But, why would God pay such a high price to bring us to life again? Could it be that we are prized above all creation...that we are loved by the God who made the heavens and the earth.

Shot over more than a year, this film follows the creation, casting and placing of the final sculpture. Sitting in the elegant country house garden at Ragley Hall, Tin suggests a kitchen container or a hamburger and yet is at the same time defiantly abstract.  Krebber is a young sculptor from Germany who studied at the Royal College of Art and now works in London. The surprising range of his work, and the processes which create it, are revealed here as he talks engagingly about how to create seriously flippant objects. His art, made with diverse materials including balloons and Cling Film as well as traditional media, has a unique deadpan humour. Its effect, the artist hopes, is to make you smile and shiver at the same time.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/7/4/9/3/6/1074936-theeye-gereon-krebber-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=1d40cdd11c"},{"name":"Pearl Jam: Melbourne 2006 - Night 1","tagline":"","description":"Pearl Jam play the first of three nights at Rod Laver Arena, Melbourne, Australia on November 13th 2006. >> SETLIST: Wasted Reprise, Life Wasted, Animal, Spin the Black Circle, Corduroy, Severed Hand, Jeremy, Given to Fly, Marker in the Sand, Even Flow, Insignificance, Army Reserve, Daughter (with \\"Another Brick in the Wall Part 2\\" tag), Leatherman, Do the Evolution, Better Man (with \\"Save It for Later\\" tag), Rearviewmirror >> ENCORE: Inside Job, Once, Come Back, Black, Alive >> ENCORE 2: Dead Man, State of Love and Trust, Comatose, Why Go, Rockin' in the Free World (Neil Young cover), Yellow Ledbetter (with \\"Little Wing\\" tag)","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/4/9/5/4/9/1049549-pearl-jam-melbourne-2006-night-1-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=737655453f"},{"name":"Cigaretta mon Amour","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Ones Last Sleep","tagline":"","description":"Coma - that's the shocking diagnosis.
