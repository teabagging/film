Now he's back to look at more recent work and to question whether modern art can still be shocking in its originality and understanding. In an age of media saturation it's perhaps even harder to tell what is good art and what is bad; but Hughes cuts through the marketing and the hype to reveal the art that is vital and will last; the art which defines the times in which we live. In a film which features interviews with David Hockney, Paula Rego, Jeff Koons and Sean Scully, Robert Hughes makes the case that painting, drawing, and the search for beauty matter more than ever before.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/8/6/9/4/0/686940-the-new-shock-of-the-new-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=2854989cd0"},{"name":"Uma Homenagem a Aluzio Netto","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/8/3/7/0/7/383707-uma-homenagem-a-aluizio-netto-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=0aaab81913"},{"name":"Sexual Confessions","tagline":"","description":"Director Ted W.

His memories are expressed in an often recurring scene, in which songs by Alec Empire, Macy Gray and Robert Schumann roughly tell the story. This small history is alternated with the tragic fate of the Namibian Heroro people, many thousands of whom died early last century in concentration camps that had been set up by the German colonisers near Luderitz. The depiction of this history is cruder and more poignant, with slanting frames, odd camera angles and a multi-layered sound sculpture.

A socially engaged documentarian, Wildenhahn is also perplexed by this issue and spends considerable time trying to place Bausch in a context outside of the aesthetic. Still, the dance company's daily life and the excruciating rehearsal and performance schedule is solidly captured. The film begins cleverly: a dance critic offers sagacious comments on ballet dancers finishing their careers at mid-thirty just when, according to Bausch, the \\"aspects of misery, suffering and fear of death should become an integral part of a dancer's spiritual and psychological make-up.\\" Wildenhahn's camera glides over the dancers' bodies as Bausch leads them through their paces, a consummate teacher. Leaving behind rehearsals of \\"Bandonen\\" and \\"Walzer,\\" Wildenhahn then ventures out into the streets of Wuppertal searching for the dance of the common people.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Die Schsse der Arche Noah","tagline":"","description":"Things are not going well for Klaus Wensloff.

In this one-man tour de force, Bagby accompanies himself on an Anglo-Saxon harp. Using the entire range of his voice, he delivers this gripping tale in Old English, as it could have been experienced more than one thousand years ago. This performance speaks to the lovers of Beowulf and the oral epic, early music enthusiasts, Tolkien fans, medievalists, and anyone searching for virtuoso storytelling or a glimpse into the fascinating beginnings of the English language.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/3/3/4/3/4/533434-beowulf-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=e42eb01786"},{"name":"Slow Mirror","tagline":"","description":"Do you know what barman pours for spirits?
