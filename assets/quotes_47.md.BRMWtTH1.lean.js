With magnificent sets, high drama and compelling music, this production offers a musical journey which starts in sixteenth century England but still resonates today through a timeless question: How far can a man of power go with his conquests?","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/2/2/6/4/5/1022645-henry-viii-saint-saens-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=9b78546e9f"},{"name":"Lucid","tagline":"","description":"A horror short student film.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Portas de Vidro","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/1/2/8/0/2/1012802-portas-de-vidro-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=2395b7a15a"},{"name":"Casa Segura","tagline":"","description":"A man buys a big house in Rio de Janeiro.

What is the secret to turning water into wine? Ruthless talk show host Mary Malone interviews the one and only Jesus of Nazareth (if that is even his real name) to cut through centuries of misunderstandings, debunking the miraculous stories we all know and love (but understand so little of).
