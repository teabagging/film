The Titanic sank in April 1912, and her sister ship, the Britannic, ultimately suffered the fate, sinking in 1916 due to an explosion caused by an underwater mine.  In the wake of the Titanic disaster, Britannic was re-engineered to be even stronger. And yet she sank in just 55 minutes - three times faster than Titanic. It's one of Britain's greatest untold disaster stories. Now on the 100th anniversary, presenters Kate Humble and Andy Torbet piece together exactly what happened in those 55 minutes.  While Andy makes a dangerous dive to the wreck, Kate speaks to descendants of the survivors. The characters she uncovers include Violet 'Miss Unsinkable' Jessops, who survived both Titanic and Britannic, Captain 'Iceberg Charlie' Bartlett and lookout Archie Jewell, who miraculously survived while those around him died.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/6/9/4/7/6/369476-titanic-s-tragic-twin-the-britannic-disaster-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=225d8c108e"},{"name":"Don't Let Her Out","tagline":"Something lives in the mirror, lurking in the shadows... to kill.","description":"A young woman hangs an old mirror in her apartment, unaware of its dark history.

This was a student film made with the assistance of a BFI grant and its influences include the British Free Cinema movement, John Cassavetes' Shadows (1959) and, for the love scene, Alain Resnais's Hiroshima Mon Amour (France, 1959).  The film's young hero is a cross between James Dean's troubled teenager in Rebel Without a Cause (US, 1955) and Albert Finney's defiant mechanic in Saturday Night and Sunday Morning (d. Karel Reisz, 1960). Initially portrayed as a self-assured, arrogant and immature teenager, his chance meeting with a pretty, sophisticated middle-class artist reveals a more insecure, fragile side. The climactic love-making scene earned Scott the first X certificate given to an amateur filmmaker.

Branches of pink cherry blossoms etched against a vivid blue sky are the starting point for this sensual visual haiku. Through a fluid application of electronic processing, Kubota layers, digitizes, slows, colorizes and ultimately abstracts the cherry blossoms, creating poetic transmutations of space and image. The mesmerizing and unexpectedly witty confluence of serene blossoms and energetic imaging effectsthe transformation of the organic into the electronicis quintessential Kubota.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/2/6/5/1/5/526515-rock-video-cherry-blossom-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=c8187a20ee"},{"name":"The Last Night of Madam Chin","tagline":"","description":"Set in Shanghai in the 1940s.
