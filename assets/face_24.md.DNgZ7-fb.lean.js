But since the land is owned by the state, the local government actually has absolute control. The so-called democratically elected village chief quickly learns that his role is to cooperate with the government in using land to develop the economy. Power-to-money transactions are open secrets. Due to the uneven economic development in the villages, each has a different story, but the use of land for profit is a constant theme. The filming location is a rural village in the outside Beijing. Less of focus is how villages elect than the mutation after. Faced with huge land assets and overseeing relationships between land, power, economics, social systems, how does a hard-working, upright peasant conduct himself? This film documents the pain: the experience of soul sublimation and degeneration. We see 'birth defects' in this \\"democracy\\"  one without checks and balances, grafted onto autocracy.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Tough Guys Wear Pink","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Lords Of The Ring - The Appendices - Part 1 - From Book To Visions","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/5/6/4/1/5/1156415-le-seigneur-des-anneaux-les-appendices-premiere-partie-d-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=1192b1ee5d"},{"name":"Paradies in den Bergen","tagline":"","description":"Katja Stern, a successful newspaper editor, is shocked to find that the tensions in her marriage with Erik, a no less successful lawyer, have led to health problems for her 12-year-old son.

The only movement is in his eyes, and ever so slight movements of his head.  Lax does not look at the camera, his eyes are mostly downcast, but he is awake and aware, watching and waiting, and you are drawn into his profound stillness. All of those who were able to meet Lax during his lifetime consider it a particular stroke of fortune.  They say that from that point on he became part of their bodies and souls, as though they had met a true saint. My Eye Your Eye is like being in the presence of holiness.  For 20 minutes.

Young people who, emerging from years of intense political activism and profound social and cultural changes (the 70s), are about to enter a new decade (the 80s) lived under the banner of rampantism and hedonism. A document attentive to individual behavior, to original ideas, to communicative intentions that go beyond parched languages. Facce di festa is built by assembling material collected with different cinematographic techniques: hidden camera, behavioral interviews, descriptive images. In the film, there is an attempt to create a delicate but tenacious interference between the author's narration and the viewer's perception. The camera becomes a vehicle for forcing the cinematographic narration by seeking a new space in the presence of the spectator.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/2/8/6/1/3/628613-facce-di-festa-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=6ccd116315"},{"name":"Lucky Luke - Les Dalton contre Sherlock Holmes","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/1/7/3/7/2/317372-lucky-luke-les-dalton-contre-sherlock-holmes-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=ece8089ed2"},{"name":"Radio Ha?ti-Inter: Straight to the Point","tagline":"","description":"1980: the repression is in full swing in Haiti.

Love is complicated. But change is possible if you're willing to do the work. Behind the Veil is a heart-wrenching story about love, marriage, betrayal, addiction, and suffering. Stacey is a successful woman trapped by the image of success. Darrel is a strong man battling his own demons in private. They are models of hope in their community but carrying pain in their heart. Together they teach us that marriage won't heal what you refuse to reveal, and love won't fix what lust broke.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/8/3/9/0/0/1083900-behind-the-veil-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=1a2bc79fdd"},{"name":"First Arena Solo Concert 2023 HAMIDASHITEIKU","tagline":"","description":"Atarashii Gakko! live at Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/9/3/2/4/1/1093241--2023-hamidashiteiku-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=b50460f861"},{"name":"November Feelings","tagline":"It's time... she's defrosting.","description":"When two friends hang out past midnight on Halloween, strange things start happening as arcane forces awaken.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"A Chant for the Bees","tagline":"","description":"A Chant for the Bees is a short film about my daily life.
