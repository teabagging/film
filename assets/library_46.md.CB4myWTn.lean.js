But the disquieting presence of her 15 year old daughter insinuates itself between them. He transfers his feelings to the young girl and relives, in a kind of addendum the same feelings that were cut short by the abrupt separation. A three-way relationship is formed, colored by tensions, generational conflicts, and subtile psychological games. Each of the three will emerge from the rapport in their own way.

At the same time, recent students are monitored showing how much change has taken place in the school, regarding the role of housewives today in terms of gender role and the basic values such as all kinds of efficiency, maintenance of clothing, protecting the environment and preventing food waste.

He embodied the jovial side of the Third Reich. Yet the same man who organised dissolute bacchanals also founded the Gestapo, set up the first concentration camps, and had his own comrades murdered in the purge of 1934.
