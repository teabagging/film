Mount Rushmore is carved into the granite spires of the Black Hills, which are sacred to the victims of the Wounded Knee massacre and their descendants. Today, Wounded Knee is located in one of the poorest counties in the United States with social and economic standards comparable to those of developing nations. By contrast, Mount Rushmore is a hub of tourism and commerce. The film approaches contrasts and the complex web of past and present relationships between the two memory sites through visual montage and interviews with the people who live at, work at and visit each of the memorials.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Sacrow: Das verwundete Paradies","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"?adqa","tagline":"","description":"A kaleidoscopic view of friendship transcending borders.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Sadko.
