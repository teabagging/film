Rallying came alive again as spectators enjoyed the spectacle of such brilliant drivers as Carlos Sainz, Timo Salonen, Didier Auriol, Colin McRae, Hannu Mikkola, Juha Kankunnen and Tommi Makinen, behind the wheel of machinery with performance on a par with the old Group B \\"supercars\\" which so entranced world audiences in the mid-80s.

Manfred Kaufmann's first film reports on tensions which may arise from the contradictions between collective and individual feelings. He works with subtle and psychologically perfected indications which explain the symptoms and illustrate the reactions. But this film is also a vehement attack on bourgeois feelings and the resulting behaviours. He shows character traits which use masks to simulate emotion as well as those which are ready to remove their masks in order to let feelings take effect.

All you have to do is ask. Such advice is not so straightforward when you can't speak the language. By 1951, Australian postwar migration programmes were geared to receiving large numbers of non-British migrants.  Considerable efforts were made to overcome prejudice on the part of the predominantly British-derived community towards the newcomers.  Double Trouble was an attempt to make the point with humour.  Bob and Stan, two Aussie blokes, are magically transported to the streets of a foreign country, where their inability to communicate gets them into a tight spot. They discover that it's not easy being a foreigner in a strange land. The central message in this film is that Australia needs migrants so Australians should make them feel welcome and offer assistance, not complaints.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/5/0/9/0/2/750902-double-trouble-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=5868ef7e82"},{"name":"Fuoco nero","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Thermal Revolution","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"1867 and After","tagline":"","description":"In this short film, a curious high school civics class has a lot of questions about Canadian history.
