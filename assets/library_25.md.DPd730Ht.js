It captures scenes virtually inaccessible to most visitors: sunrises, sunsets and moonrises when the park is not open; virgin snow after a winter storm when park officials closed the road and turned back travelers. Here, the viewer can also experience the changing of seasons, rarely seen wildlife, and the unusual sight of a river flowing through these desert highlands. This picture poem allows an understanding of the petrified forest that comes from the heart and soul, as well as the mind.

This 60-minute documentary explores why some feel the \\"Fed\\" is a \\"bunch of organized crooks\\" (as John Adams put it) and others feel some of its practices \\"are in violation of the U.S. Constitution.\\" Discover why experts agree the Fed is a banking cartel that benefits mainly bankers, their clients in need of \\"easy money\\" and bailouts, and a Congress that would rather go deeper in debt than seek funding from its constituents. Long-term studies indicate the Federal Reserve System encourages war, destabilizes the economy (by causing boom and bust cycles), generates inflation (a hidden tax) and is the supreme instrument of unjust enrichment for a select group of insiders. If you are fed up with an ever-expanding state and corporations that are \\"too-big-to-fail,\\" look no farther than the fiat currency printed by the Federal Reserve System.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/9/0/7/3/8/190738-fiat-empire-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=41d6be83ba"},{"name":"The Accidental Witness","tagline":"Working late can be a killer.","description":"A murderer goes after a female attorney when he thinks that she has witnessed one of his killings.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/4/6/2/7/84627-the-accidental-witness-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=ead3ef1aca"},{"name":"Porcupine Tree: Rockpalast","tagline":"Porcupine Tree: Rockpalast","description":"Porcupine Tree live on Rockpalast 19 November 2005.

The French libretto was adapted from Maurice Maeterlinck's Symbolist play Pellas et Mlisande. It premiered at the Opra-Comique in Paris on 30 April 1902 with Jean Prier as Pellas and Mary Garden as Mlisande in a performance conducted by Andr Messager, who was instrumental in getting the Opra-Comique to stage the work. The only opera Debussy ever completed, it is considered a landmark in 20th-century music.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/9/0/3/1/9/190319-claude-debussy-pelleas-et-melisande-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=d2ac3b09cd"},{"name":"No More Reality","tagline":"","description":"A static shot which lasts 38 minutes and portrays Philippe Parreno as a multilingual lecturer, whose topics include Philippo Lippi and Buren.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Je t'aime mlancolie","tagline":"","description":"Short film for the 1991 single","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/2/5/9/4/6/725946-je-t-aime-melancolie-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=be47ed9acd"},{"name":"Ryakudatsu ai","tagline":"","description":"The fear of the fiercely obsessive woman who deprives her best friend of her husband.

He is imprisoned at about the same time that Hitler and the nascent Nazi party attempt the infamous Beer Hall Putsch, and the gallery manager's girlfriend and a Swiss writer valiantly (and unsuccessfully) attempt to get better justice for him.
