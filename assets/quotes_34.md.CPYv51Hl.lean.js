This piece is an image/sound portrait of a personal geography as well as formal investigation of digital media. Captured entirely on a cell phone, the camera records a landscape in constant motion and disintegration. This fluctuating image is married to a sound-scape that grasps for connection that reaches over distance. It is generated from the messages left by friends and loved ones on my cellphone over the course of several years. The raw material of both image and sound come from the same place, the cell phone, which I use to record the environment around me as I move across the Canadian landscape. Rarely does one stay where one is born, we move, modern life almost necessitates it.

All these people have found beauty and inspiration in London's dirt and grime.  Architects and social engineers have strived to organise London, but painters, writers and many more have revelled in its labyrinthine unruliness.

L. Stevenson \\"The Black Arrow\\" for Tv is to shift the conflict of the War of the Two Roses from England to Tirolo, at the border between Italy and Germany, where the conflict between the Pope and the Empire takes place in the same years. This is the transition period in which Middle Age - embodied in the tyrannical feudatory Raniero von Rottemburg - gives way to Modern times - represented by Cusano and his Court. The main theme of the novel is that one cannot fight against evil by doing evil. The protagonists of our series will come to understand that the aim does not justify the means and that justice has to replace revenge. The Black Arrow is a Bildungsroman about growth and love in wartime: at the end of the 15th century the nobles connected to the Asburgo's Court fight against those related to the Church and to its spiritual master Nicolo Cusano - Nikolaus von Kues - bishop of Bressanone.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/3/3/2/2/6/1133226-the-black-arrow-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=1c06c5bb02"},{"name":"Perpetual Motion","tagline":"","description":"Florence, 15th Century.
