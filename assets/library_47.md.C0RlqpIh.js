Love is not enough to achieve the set goals and is seen as an obstacle, and you have to make a pact with the world of crime and often sacrifice friends and family for ambition. The only value left to the human being is fading over time and is being replaced by the rebellious anger. The film illustrates a young man who regains freedom but does not divide that command and illuminated by an old professor who gives advice and commands from prison. The perpetrators and law of survival comes instinctively from the need of self-defense. A movie that makes us love more people, the world, nature, and respect lives more.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/2/7/9/6/2/527962-love-is-not-enough-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=71ce9aa112"},{"name":"Omar Sy, c'est ta chance","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/9/2/6/2/8/492628-omar-sy-c-est-ta-chance-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=47d236ef66"},{"name":"Ancora lucciole","tagline":"","description":"In 1972, in one of his best-known articles, Pier Paolo Pasolini spoke of the disappearance of fireflies.

Combining lyricism, realism and irony, The Devil's Dream explores the soul of this paradoxical country. We discover not only the beauty of the landscape, the people and their creative imagination, but also the wretched conditions of life, the spectre of violence, and a pervasive sense of the absurd.  Guatemala is a society split between native and non-native, rich and poor, civil and military. Native people pick cotton for two dollars a day, their children work for half that amount. Those who dare to protest risk their lives.

Rehad Desai documented this historic event in his 2013 film MINERS SHOT DOWN. He refers to the incident once again in his latest film and shows how the ANC is undermining its close connections to the trade unions it set up as a freedom movement under Nelson Mandela, and how students have also turned on the party to protest against tuition fees under the motto #FeesMustFall. The film's compelling footage unmasks the cynical despotism of corrupt president Jacob Zuma, who is chiefly responsible for the ANC's demise and its catastrophic losses at the most recent elections.

'Shady Lady,' after 16 hours and 35 minutes in the air, ran out of fuel and was crash-landed in a salt-pan, in the remotest part of Northern Australia.

With the cost of living in Hawai'i estimated at 27 percent higher than the continental United States, large numbers of Hawaiians have left the islands to pursue professional and educational opportunities. Today, with more Native Hawaiians living on the mainland than in the state of Hawai'i, the hula has traveled with them. From the suburbs of Los Angeles to the San Francisco Bay Area, the largest Hawaiian communities have settled in California, and the hula continues to connect communities to their heritage on distant shores.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/6/5/7/0/1/365701-american-aloha-hula-beyond-hawai-i-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=c8ec2961e4"},{"name":"Sabbath Entertainment","tagline":"","description":"It's Sabbath eve.

Shades of difference between Islam's foundation and that of its counterparts prove more fascinating than divisive, e.g., Islam claims a direct line with Abraham via the latter's cast-off son, Ismael, while Judaism is linked to Abraham's more favored child, Isaac. Jesus, the Virgin Mary, and the angel Gabriel each play major roles in the Quran; it was Gabriel, in fact, who transmitted the Word of God to the 40-year-old, seemingly ordinary Muhammad in the 7th century, making him extraordinary to millions today. Sure, anti-Western sentiment creeps into the story, but in every important way Inside Islam is an antidote to gross anti-Muslim bigotry. --Tom Keogh","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/5/1/7/7/5/151775-inside-islam-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=465a89bdfd"},{"name":"Another pretty face","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/3/7/5/6/1/337561-another-pretty-face-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=c3ecbbf4ab"},{"name":"Mapmaker","tagline":"","description":"Hired to draw a map of tourist sites in a small Northern Ireland town, cartographer Richie Markey (Brian F.
