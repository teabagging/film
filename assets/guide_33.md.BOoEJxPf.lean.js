It was the egg of an extinct bird known as the 'elephant bird' - the largest bird that ever lived. It has been one of his most treasured possessions ever since.  Fifty years older, he now returns to the island to find out more about this amazing creature and to see how the island has changed. Could the elephant bird's fate provide lessons that may help protect Madagascar's remaining wildlife?  Using Zoo Quest archive and specially shot location footage, this film follows David as he revisits scenes from his youth and meets people at the front line of wildlife protection. On his return, scientists at Oxford University are able to reveal for the first time how old David's egg actually is - and what that might tell us about the legendary elephant bird.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/7/1/1/2/97112-attenborough-and-the-giant-egg-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=d472da860e"},{"name":"Complexo: Parallel Universe","tagline":"How is it to survive in the most dangerous slum in Rio de Janeiro?","description":"No Rio de Janeiro, a 13 km do Cristo Redentor, dois portugueses aventuraram-se na mais temida favela do Brasil, onde moram mais de 300.000 pessoas - o Complexo do Alem?o.

W. Pabst's last French production before his (ill-timed) return to Nazi-occupied Austria in 1941.

Among the few students who can claim family stability is Micheline Presle, but even her happiness is threatened when her lawyer father Andre Luguet inaugurates an affair with stage actress Jacqueline Debulac. With the help of Debulac's daughter Louisa Carletti, Presle is able to break up her father's romance and deliver him into the open arms of her mother Marcelle Chantal. On the whole, the performance by the younger cast members are more convincing than those rendered by the film's so-called adults.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/4/3/9/2/0/243920-girls-in-distress-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=46f7669761"},{"name":"The Outcasts of Poker Flat","tagline":"Oakhurst the Gambler Lives Again in This Drama of a Two Gun Man and a One Man Woman!","description":"The 1937 film version of Bret Harte's story, starring Preston Foster.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/2/6/2/3/2/126232-the-outcasts-of-poker-flat-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=341ae6682d"},{"name":"When the Cat's Away","tagline":"","description":"The mice will loot the kitchen.
