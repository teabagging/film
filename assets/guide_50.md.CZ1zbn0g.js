All the episodes are about double standards and the topics of heroism and death. Something very small meets something very big (a tiny knight meets a huge dragon, an old Mexican goblin meets a man, a tiny Professor meets real-life cows, two mobsters meet the Big Man). All these meetings result in the heroic death of the small principal characters.

Rather than define brain injury survivors by their deficits and limit their narratives to crash and recovery stories, we allow them to examine their lives, struggles, triumphs, self-doubt, goals, and personal agency. The film reveals art-making not as rehabilitation but a way to reconnect to a sense of purpose and pride, to protest disability stigma and social isolation, and to contribute to society. Brain injury survivors are not individuals on a private journey of healing; they are rooted in society, one that is often inaccessible and not understanding or accommodating.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/4/0/8/8/3/440883-who-am-i-to-stop-it-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=253cdd0c46"},{"name":"Caterpillar Kisses","tagline":"","description":"After feeling butterflies for the first time, a girl is shown what it will feel like to fall in love but she also experiences what it will all lead to: pain and heartbreak.

McLean is shown practicing in his apartment and - briefly - playing with his quintet, but most of the running time is spent at Hartford in the classroom - and what classes they must have been.
