Progressive Republican Party came up against the Republican People's Party that ruled the country. However, this period, when a new republic was built in pain, did not allow an oppositional voice to survive. The Progressive Party was closed after six months. Some of the rulers were imprisoned. Some of them were sentenced on death rows in the case of the assassination of Atatrk.The second attempt was made six months later, in 1930, with the Free Party.

A procession registered as political demonstration with only 150 colorfully dressed people dancing to house and techno. What started out small developed over the years into the largest party on the planet with visitors from all over the world. In 1999, 1.5 million people took part. With the help of interviews with important organizers and contemporary witnesses, the documentary reflects the history of the Love Parade, but also illuminates the dark side of how commerce and money business increasingly destroyed the real spirit, long before the emigration to other cities and the Love Parade disaster of Duisburg in 2010, which caused an era to end in deep grief.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/4/8/3/9/1/648391-love-parade-when-love-learned-to-dance-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=691cea1370"},{"name":"The Sleepover","tagline":"","description":"Two boys in art school have a sleepover that allows them to question their sexualities.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/9/2/2/3/3/592233-the-sleepover-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=fd9031e7ce"},{"name":"The Fixer: Millennium","tagline":"","description":"2008 year.

Shot in a large can company, we actually pre-recorded the dialogue in the \\"can\\" as the only quiet room in the facility was the toilet. The actors then went onstage to mouth the dialogue, which was piped into the P.A. system. Nobody could really memorize all that verbiage for the three hour shooting schedule we were assigned every Thursday afternoon so it worked out pretty well and the thing should be viewed as a sort of puppet show as their jaws do drop now and then to the words. This was also planned as a major, star vehicle for Linda Martinez, an Iowa pie-maker with aspirations toward more dubious delights.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/6/1/6/5/5/561655-kiss-of-frankenstein-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=427f1a45b1"},{"name":"Living Space","tagline":"","description":"Living Space is a film about the relationship between architecture and illness.
