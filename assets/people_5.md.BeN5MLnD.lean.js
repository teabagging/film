Follow the clues as experts use erosion studies on the rune stone and match symbols in Templar ruins all over Europe to support this theory.

When there's social activity - a powhiri, the haka before a rugby match, or just kids clambering on and off a roof - these filmmakers evince something like historical distance, framing ritual and play in the eternal overarching melancholy of mist and forest.

The Soviet blockade included all rail, road and water communications. On June 26, 1948, the United States and Britain began a year-long effort, documented here, to supply West Berlin by air. By July, the Soviet army had increased into 40 divisions - against eight for the West. The blockade ended on May 12, 1949. This is the story of the blockade, told by those involved. They describe the enormous logistical effort to transport some 2.3 million tons of food, fuel and equipment -- a battle the Western powers won.

On their sons' 21st birthday, Eckberg tells them the great family secret:  Knut and Michael aren't his children (happy birthday, kids ... oh!  and did I mention Santa Claus doesn't exist either?).  But thankfully, the news gets better:  their real mother died giving birth to them (guilt trip ... guilt trip!) and the Eckbergs decided to adopt the boys and bring them up in a proper family (no doubt so they could shatter their lives with this tale on their 21st birthday).
