Depicting men and women living out their lives against the haunting landscape that surrounds them, most of MacLeod's work is firmly based in Cape Breton even if his characters stray elsewhere. Focusing on the complexities and abiding mysteries at the heart of human relationships, MacLeod maps the close bonds and impassable chasms that lie between people and invokes memory and myth to celebrate the continuity of the generations. This film portrait explores the life and work of this giant of literature.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/7/7/8/2/8/277828-reading-alistair-macleod-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=efaabb975e"},{"name":"Tv? br?der emellan","tagline":"","description":"The brothers Ingmar and Gustav Nilsson are running a motel and a shop where everything from car tires to fish nets can be bought.

His technique, a systematic form of question and answer \\"the Socratic method\\", was delivered with such dazzling irony that he became a celebrity in his day. Yet, by challenging tradition and convention, he also made enemies. Eventually he was put on trial, found guilty, and sentenced to drink deadly hemlock.
