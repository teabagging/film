The bands music and lyrics frequently conjure notions of romantic suffering and melancholythemes common to Kjartanssons emotive, theatrical work.  As the hours pass and fatigue sets in, the musicians subtly alter their song; the original track is always recognizable but is also shown to be elastic and expressive rather than rigid. Kjartansson is sometimes visible in the role of roadie, offering water and food to the performers throughout the concert. Multiple camera angles grant the viewer access to both the perspective of the musicians and that of the audience, as the band and the crowd feed off each others energy with every repetition.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/2/1/9/4/6/521946-a-lot-of-sorrow-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=45e66990c6"},{"name":"Las Mariposas de Sadourn","tagline":"","description":"A circus dwarf, imprisoned for a crime of passion, seeks a release from both his incarceration and his diminutive body while wooing a porn actress.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/7/0/2/1/117021-sadourni-s-butterflies-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=282d6ba07c"},{"name":"Endless","tagline":"","description":"There are old stories of children disappearing by the river's edge.

This is the surprising sense of the film, its inner music. () Early in the film I recall a chair held in the strong afternoon sunlight. Even though you show it from many angles, it has a potent stillness. This strikes me as a good example of how you embody an active sense of seeing in your filming, and you reflect back to us the paradox that it is in movement that we create stillness.
