Traces of natural forms (leaves, twigs) ground what is an otherwise indescribable procession of images. Though the visuals evade literal synopsizing, theres a simplicity and concision to the film that allows the viewer to get caught up in their own experience rather than get sidetracked on decoding the filmmakers intentions.

Dora was one of the sport's iconic figures. He railed against the commercialization of surfing, yet endorsed one of the best-selling surfboard models of the mid-'60s surf boom; he decried competitive surfing, yet still chose to enter some, and floated schemes to promote others; he shunned publicity, yet managed to use the surf media to create an almost mythic persona for himself. Chasing Dora takes on one of his radical ideas--that the ultimate test of a truly great surfer would be in a contest for the longest wave ridden, on a self-made wooden board, with no equipment or accessories that stemmed from the industrial age--no plastics, no neoprene suits, no surf leashes.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/4/6/0/8/5/946085-chasing-dora-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=4a77f7c5fd"},{"name":"I Got Music ~Haruno Sumire in Concert~","tagline":"","description":"A concert starring Haruno Sumire held in 2005.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/8/9/9/8/5/889985-i-got-music-haruno-sumire-in-concert--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=f6ac76baed"},{"name":"Colorform","tagline":"","description":"Directed by Raymond Salvatore Harmon","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Dandy","tagline":"","description":"Follows experiments of fictional 19th century aristocrat Monsieur Lautramont, a hypochondriac dandy committed to the pursuit of true aesthetic perfection which he calls urge-ingeniousness.

One must imagine that they were terrified much of the time, but there is very little sign of doubt or anxiety on the brave faces in Iliffe Cozens' film.  Although certain scenes had to be re-created for technical reasons, the raid is a real one and there are no actors.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/9/3/9/4/4/493944-night-bombers-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=24a70d0528"},{"name":"EastEnders: Pat and Mo","tagline":"","description":"This special episode revealed what caused the feud between Pat Evans and Mo Harris that lasted until Pat's death.

Special highlight: Neuenfels places an actor at every singers side who not only takes over his role for the spoken original scripts, but also interacts with his singing double and other characters of the piece. In recent decades, directors have sought to revitalise the somewhat naive plot of the Entfhrung with fresh interpretations. Hans Neuenfels, who produced his first Mozart here in Stuttgart, retains the storys naivety and absurdity.

What you see on-screen is the real thing: raw, revealing and utterly fascinating. Over a 10-month period, we follow six high-risk offenders and the parole officers and therapists whose job is to make sure they stay clean, stay out of trouble and stay out of jail. The offenders put up with urine tests for drugs, random curfew checks and therapy sessions. Most work at it, some feel hopeless, others just go through the motions. Their stories are at turns bizarre, tragic, disturbing and endearing.

Beard is now more or less a street person since his wife left him. Before that, he was a social worker. \\"Foureyes\\" is a nebbish science teacher, who can't get anyone to take him seriously -- certainly not his students. He seeks solace in the quiet of the stars, which he views in his telescope at night. Finally, Gerdo is a fellow who is a master of many trades, successful at almost everything he does, except in his own eyes. Each new challenge proves unsatisfying when met. The only thing he wants is the one thing he can't bring about: the return of his old girlfriend, who left him for some boring civil servant. He sees her everywhere, and images of her haunt him constantly.
