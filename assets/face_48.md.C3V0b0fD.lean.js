Jonas performs wearing a veiled doll face as she manipulates childlike objects or partners a skeleton in a danse macabre.

Jean-Marc Manteau worked on the sounds made by wood when split and cut down. I wanted the sound emited by the tree during its existence to echo Medusa's life and death. The projection apparatus multiplies the representations of the Gorgon in order to make it difficult to gaze at her face. Real shots and drawings intermingle during the projection. The treatment of the myth is partly based on Medusa by Jean Clair in which the Gorgon is a terrifying impersonation of woman's sexual power. The Greek myth officially confirms the male deities' supremacy through the beheading of the female character by Perseus. Through the myth, the film tries to show the mechanism of man's violence against any kind of female power.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Mencari Ramlee","tagline":"","description":"Plot Unknown","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/3/4/6/2/0/1034620-mencari-ramlee-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=59d0518666"},{"name":"Men's Room","tagline":"","description":"While a guy steps down the stairs of a public toilet, he soon realizes that the place hides more than he ever could have imagined.

Throughout the decade Resch developed astoundingly original methods for folding vast sheets of paper in elaborate tessellated patterns creating swooping, moldable surfaces that he dreamed of applying on an architectural scale. Like Fuller, Resch wanted to create alternatives to the traditional orthogonal grid, and in his quest for a new building aesthetic he tirelessly explored a kind of embodied geometry. Any shape you can make on a computer, Resch declared you could also make with paper and sticks. Imagine this ethic taken onto a monumental scale. Paper and Stick Thing Film  C a rarely screened movie from 1970 C  documents Reschs researches from the critical period of 1961-1969.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/7/9/5/4/3/779543-paper-and-stick-film-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=5f615308ac"},{"name":"Paper Circus","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Papir og pap er penge v?rd","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"The Park","tagline":"","description":"An uninterrupted 58-minute capture of the action on an unfenced basketball court adjacent to the Walt Whitman housing projects in Fort Greene Brooklyn, New York.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/6/0/9/9/3/660993-the-park-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=f25257a509"},{"name":"Paroles de commer?ants.","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/0/1/6/4/8/701648-paroles-de-commercants--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=e0c542a084"},{"name":"Party Done","tagline":"","description":"A portrait of a crime-show host in Trinidad who attempts to bring justice to murder and kidnapping victims.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Pasaia","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Passin' and Going","tagline":"Moving forward isn't as easy","description":"Former war veteran, Dennis Mcready, arrives home after the extreme events of warfare and losing his best friend.
