Shot in extreme slow motion, this film creates an unusual and bizarre sense of timelessness and distance. This allows the viewer to become involved with every subtle movement within the frame. The \\"center\\" of the frame is constantly emptying itself, creating a vacuum, and is left entirely open, only to be filled again, not with images, however, but with the mind's eye. The space created in the center of the frame allows one to pass through the film and enter an inner dimension of visual perception.

Sharing one of the recurrent stylistic motifs of the Georgian documentaries shown here, an uncanny atmosphere is created by the use of post-production sound and chiaroscuro lighting. In effect, the removal of the bread from the oven is witnessed with the same sense of wonder as would greet the appearance of a flying saucer. When sticking the dough to the tandoor, the baker moves half of his body into this dungeon C an image at once frightening and mesmerising. Nowhere else has bread been seen like this, save perhaps for Night of the Living Bread (Kevin S. OBrien, 1990). But this is hardly a parody: here the most essential human foodstuff meets an expressionist sensibility. In fact, along with Manoel de Oliveiras O P?o (also showing this year), Khabazebi presents some of the most beautiful images of our daily bread on screen.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/6/3/4/5/4/863454-bread-makers-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=f50fc26a68"},{"name":"Bent Al-Sheikh","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/9/8/8/0/3/998803-bent-al-sheikh-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=afd53ce5fa"},{"name":"Die Herberge","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Days of Our Death","tagline":"","description":"Days of Our Death is a documentary about workers in an army occupied tin mine in Bolivia.

This unusual edition of the long-running series Secrets of Life tells the story of the village's famous son, Rev Gilbert White, whose 1789 book The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne is a classic of natural history. The film follows in his footsteps, with camera rather than quill in hand, focusing on nature but also taking in views of the village and its human inhabitants.  The ingenious close coverage of bird, reptile and other wildlife was the stock-in-trade of the filmmakers at Gaumont-British Instructional, producers of the series. Under the direction of the redoubtable Mary Field, the behind-screen talent here includes legendary 'cine-biologists' Percy Smith and Oliver Pike. A tribute by one generation of pioneering naturalists to another, it's a quietly moving film in spite of its clipped English reserve - or perhaps partly because of it.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"٧اէ֧ߧڧ ѧݧڧߧԧѧէ","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/6/8/5/0/4/768504---0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=04d18b61ab"},{"name":"En flicka f?r mej","tagline":"","description":"The story about Klas Ekengren, the mayor of a small Swedish town, and his mother Alma.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/5/7/9/9/1/1157991-en-flicka-for-mej-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=df820baf06"},{"name":"Due cuori","tagline":"","description":"An employee embezzles a sum belonging to the company where he works and loses it by making a wrong speculation.

In this process, Muslims who were forced to become Christians but continued to live their faith in secret would be called Morisco, and now Andalusian Muslims will be called Morisco.  While the forced conversion continued with all its violence, the inquisition courts stepped in. The Moriscos, who were suspected of being secret Muslims, were tried and burned at the inquisition.  However, the Spanish forces, the largest empire of the time, suppressed this rebellion in a very bloody way. There was a massacre, especially in the Galera region, where civilians took refuge. There are still places where Muslims took refuge in this region.
