At present, the right to food is surely, of all human rights, the one that is violated with the most impunity. Jean Ziegler argues that hunger is caused by human injustice and assures that today the world could produce enough food to feed the world's population. Among the main causes of this disaster, Ziegler points to stock market speculation, which forces cereal prices to rise, and the appearance of biofuels as a new source of energy. Burning food to keep millions of cars on the roads is a crime against humanity. Hunger is no inescapable destiny. A starving child is killed.

I was motivated mostly by a longing for decent coffee. I wanted to become healthy after eating an unhealthy but fabulous tasting meal. I succeeded in walking over 100 blocks to Tims, taking the back roads, all on foot, with no Segways or bicycles used. Hourly, I put stretches of pot-holes behind me. I saw many beautiful landscapes, met friendly people, socialist workers, and here and there the occasional milksop whiner. I got along well with all of them, and had good conversations. I must say that people in this city are generally pretty strange.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/4/1/0/9/0/741090-walking-from-sals-to-tims-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=17b1868c54"},{"name":"Walt Disney Cartoon Classics Limited Gold Edition: Silly Symphonies","tagline":"","description":"FEATURED CARTOONS Birds in the Spring (1933) The China Shop (1934) The Flying Mouse (1934) The Cookie Carnival (1935) Woodland Caf (1937) The Moth and the Flame (1938) Farmyard Symphony (1938)","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Warrant - Live in Long Island 1990","tagline":"","description":"Warrant - Live 1990","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/8/7/6/1/3/287613-warrant-live-in-long-island-1990-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=2c6b847d5d"},{"name":"Weather Report: Live In Tokyo","tagline":"","description":"Weather Report: Live In Tokyo","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/5/0/6/7/75067-weather-report-live-in-tokyo-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=175c06ca4d"},{"name":"Weekend Blockbusters - Production 8","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"What the dog wanted to tell","tagline":"","description":"Elderly man who has reached his retirement age.

In this space, which is as much a living room as it is an archive, they share their life stories with each other. The short film is a hopeful, imaginative documentary about reclaiming spaces where the identity of older LGBTQ+ individuals is not accepted. It gives an insight into the LGBTQ+ history of Rotterdam through the stories of four elderly people: lesbian activist Nell Broekhuizen, trans man Jos Niesing and married couple Tonny van Dijk, a heterosexual woman, and Arie van Dijk, a gay man. Although the stories of the four main characters seem very different at first glance, they clearly have one thing in common. Nell, Jos, Tonny and Arie have all had to search for a space in which they could be themselves. All four have had to transform traditional norms around family, faith and marriage to find space for their identity.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/5/7/3/6/3/1057363-over-roze-gesproken-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=e29d48b408"},{"name":"Atelier Beyond","tagline":"","description":"Gaspard Delanoe joined the art squatting movement and squatted an abandoned building in Paris with his friends.

Although a young man Aubry knows Ruthwen is a vampire, he is sworn to secrecy. When the young mans own lover Malwina is about to become the vampires next victim, Aubry has to choose between saving his bride or remaining true to his oath.  Der Vampyr is by a formative figure in Hanover's musical life; the composer Heinrich Marschner led the theatre that preceded the Staatsoper, as Royal Hanoverian Kapellmeister and Intendant, for almost three decades from 1831. Marschner adapted John Polidori's novella The Vampyre, which was modelled on British dandy and writer Lord Byron. Our fascination with the bloodsucking outsider is still as strong two centuries later.

PBP's 2007 release Yeah Dude follows the Poor Boyz tradition of scintillating action, sending crews to all points of the globe to capture the year?s best skiing. But when it came time to assemble the pieces, PBP started expanding its repertoire. Once the snow melted, many of Yeah Dude's athletes and crew members visited the Poor Boyz studios to give candid accounts of their seasons. The result is a much more intimate portrait of the Poor Boyz crew than you're used to, but without any consequent lulls in the action. Yeah Dude gives you all the skiing action you expect from PBP.

Die drei Komiker haben sich Anfang '99 bei einem schweren Autounfall kennen gelernt und waren sich auf Anhieb sympathisch. Mit ihrem abendfllenden Programm pr?sentieren sie eine Comedy-Show voller skurriler Gags und absurder Situationskomik. Und w?hrend sie tanzen, jazzen oder drei Geschichten auf einmal erz?hlen, erf?hrt man ganz nebenbei, wie ein ostsibirisches Ozelotm?nnchen klingt oder wie Zeugen Jehovas ausgebildet werden. Eure Mtter sind lustig, spontan und nicht zimperlich. Ihre Mischung aus Sketchen, musikalischen Einlagen und Stand-up-Comedy ist in Deutschland bisher einzigartig, und die Leute schei?en sich bei ihren Auftritten vor Lachen in die Hosen.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/5/4/9/8/25498-eure-mutter-schieb-du-sau-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=5af9280c89"},{"name":"Fatboy: The Movie","tagline":"","description":"Fatboy: The Movie tracks the circuitous route of Miles Forman on his quest to lose 50 pounds. Stunned by the notion that he could be fat for the rest of his life, determination kicks in. Inspiration arrives. Action follows. With gritty resolution, a sense of humor and true humility, Miles exposes himself in front of Landsberg's cameras in his last ditch effort to win the war. Miles is one of multimillions of Americans whose dysfunctional upbringing paved the way for a life of inactivity, self-loathing and the constant burden of being overweight. As he peels off the pounds, we discover why the odds are against us. America's poor eating habits go hand in hand with our obsession for \\"quick-fix\\" fad diets. FATBOY is interspersed with startling facts and figures, uncovering a general ignorance about weight loss programs and exposing the diet industry whose annual profits of $40 billion continue to expand in tandem with America's waistlines.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/3/3/7/3/9/1033739-fatboy-the-movie-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=71ec7c3814"},{"name":"Chucha 3","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/7/8/2/9/0/678290-chucha-3-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=3f56dcf138"},{"name":"De Michoacn a Tijuana","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/3/2/4/9/9/732499-de-michoacan-a-tijuana-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=0fe41f0eef"},{"name":"Habitacin disponible","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/5/2/4/0/3/652403-habitacion-disponible-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=c9e09845dd"},{"name":"Die Fantastischen Vier - Viel Live","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/4/7/1/1471-die-fantastischen-vier-viel-live-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=d317acf487"},{"name":"La dcima borinque?a","tagline":"","description":"Renowned Puerto Rican troubadours come together to revive the folk tradition of the Round Table and to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Don Quixote.
