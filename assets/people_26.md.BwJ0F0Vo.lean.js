This electrifying solo performance kicks off with Skyline Pigeon (taken from 'Empty Sky') before ending with a riotous version of 'Saturday Night's Alright (For Fighting)'. The setlist rips through classic after classic, including 'Rocket Man,' 'Daniel and 'Bennie and the Jets.' It was also the first time Elton performed 'Don't Go Breaking My Heart' solo. Climbing on his piano and stomping his way through this virtuoso performance, Elton leaves every ounce of himself on the stage, in a classic concert that was to be the last time he would perform a full show for another 7 months.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/4/4/8/2/8/644828-in-concert-at-edinburgh-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=f9593280e7"},{"name":"The Fox With The Rolling Pin","tagline":"","description":"Ukrainian folktale telling the story of how the sly fox tricked on village people and how they finally avenged themselves.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/1/2/9/1/1/812911-fox-with-the-rolling-pin-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=41dc144219"},{"name":"Girl In Vortex","tagline":"","description":"A short film by Katsuhiro Yamaguchi.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/6/8/2/9/5/768295-girl-in-vortex-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=881a28bf39"},{"name":"Still Life","tagline":"","description":"The production is a poetic impression, its tone is mournful.
