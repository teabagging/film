German propaganda suggested that Muslim Indian soldiers who fought for Britain were not being buried according to their beliefs, and in response the War Office opened the Muslim Burial Ground at Horsell Common, Woking, in 1917. Nineteen Muslim Indian soldiers who died in Britain during WWI were buried at the cemetery. The Muslim Burial Ground continued to be used during World War II, but became derelict after the wars. The graves were subjected to racist vandalism, prompting the Commonwealth War Graves Commission to reinter the bodies at Brookwood Military Cemetery in 1969. Adrus' footage of the Muslim Burial Ground shows the site before it was restored as a Peace Garden in 2015. Using photographs, archival footage and interviews he reflects on issues around war, migration, empire and the affinity to place and country.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Love Can Turn the World","tagline":"","description":"Includes:  Come On, Children, Let's Sing - Kim Hopper, Jessy Dixon  Love Can Turn The World - African Children's Choir  If The Lord Wasn't Walking By My Side - Ivan Parker  There's A Higher Power - Jeff & Sheri Easter  Born To Serve The Lord - Sue Dodge  Almighty - The Talley Trio  I'm Glad - Russ Taff  Livin' For The Moment - The Booth Brothers  One Day At A Time - Lynda Randle  Trying To Get A Glimpse - Ernie Haase & Signature Sound  Everything Is Going To Turn Out Right - The Isaacs  Claire De Lune / Jesus Loves Me - Anthony Burger  Hear My Song, Lord - Bill & Gloria Gaither, Guy Penrod, Doug Anderson, Sonya Isaacs, Charlotte Ritchie, Sheri Easter  I Love You, Lord  I Lost It All To Find Everything - Jessy Dixon  Unworthy - Ben Speer, Bill Gaither  There Is A River  Because He Lives - Bill Gaither, Ben Speer, Guy Penrod","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/0/1/9/5/4/701954-love-can-turn-the-world-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=b9f9a1465f"},{"name":"Love Effect","tagline":"","description":"Love Effect is a poem born out of the need to shorten the distance between you and me.

Instead of helping us grow strong, A1' milk could help trigger diabetes, heart disease, autism and schizophrenia. This high quality documentary tells a tale of cutting edge research and the corporate power games that blur the truth about a product we all know and love.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"CBS at 75","tagline":"","description":"TV special celebrating CBS's 75th birthday.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Bus Story","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Raisakotkad","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"ڧܧѧ ӧѧݧѧ٧ڧ","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Ve stnu bohyn matky zem","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Mickey 3D - Live  Saint-Etienne","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/3/2/4/9/53249-mickey-3d-live-a-saint-etienne-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=dca6d70629"},{"name":"Marcilla","tagline":"","description":"Marcilla is a magnificent contemporary interpretation of Sheridan Le Fanu's novella \\"Carmilla\\" about a lonely female student who is visited by a mysterious woman.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Heinz Rudolf Kunze - Dabeisein ist alles","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/8/1/7/8/2/281782-heinz-rudolf-kunze-dabeisein-ist-alles-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=a96c3b282c"},{"name":"Kathleen Ferrier: An Ordinary Diva","tagline":"","description":"A portrait of the great British contralto who, despite little formal musical training, rose from humble origins to become an internationally acclaimed artist before her tragic early death in 1953.

Since then, Darwinian theory has become the accepted scientific doctrine but now an Australian scientist, Ted Steele, is stirring things up again.

When the world seemd like a foreign country and when the strange language of power and materialism was the accepted tongue, these pilgrims reminded each other that they were natives of a far better place to which they were traveling.
