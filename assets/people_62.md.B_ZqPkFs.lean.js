Through this disambiguation of the heads from the objects originally intended by the artist -a series of chairs- the film created a refined perspective of the sculptural quality of the objects as entities in themselves stripped of any functional purpose. The film was informed by conversations in which I discussed with the artist his conceptual concerns in the making of the objects. The resulting silent film projection stands alone as a work in itself with an archival quality evocative of ethnological observations of tribal objects.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Heart of Steel","tagline":"","description":"Thousands of men and women from the four corners of the earth transformed Canada in an industrial power.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/1/1/5/4/3/311543-heart-of-steel-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=e254f6c6de"},{"name":"Kall Trawn (Reunin Del Cuerpo)","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/2/4/4/4/3/1124443-kalul-trawun-reunion-del-cuerpo--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=12cf454f8f"},{"name":"Los encargados","tagline":"","description":"Portraits of Franco are carried through Spain.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Meditation on silence #3","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Mike Portnoy: Testimony 2: Live in Los Angeles","tagline":"","description":"Mike's Drum-Cam footage from Neal Morse's Testimony 2 Tour.

We visually follow the material process from tree log cutting to making the tara (ghurbal frame), to ghurbal crafting, through the voice and image of two key persons: Naima, the craftswoman and owner of the frame shop, and Hoksha, the rural ghurbal craftsman. The ethnographer/filmmaker engages them to speak and we are drawn into their lives by their stories as we view self-confident mastery of their craft. While Hoksha relates how he has kept this child from his father, we see his son next to him making a modern flour sieve, having never learned the family tradition.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/0/0/6/3/6/900636-ghurbal-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=24224e0c7e"},{"name":"The Heart of Kampala","tagline":"","description":"With over 4000 minibuses pouring in at intervals, thousands of commuters and petty traders trying to scratch a living, Kampala Taxi Park gyrates with the rhythm of a typical African city.
