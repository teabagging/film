In 2003, the Melbourne University Student Union (MUSU) was on the verge of financial collapse. Allegations of corruption against the union's right-wing student leaders featured in the foremost pages of both The Australian and The Age. Having spent two years in the political wilderness, the campus' left wing factions united in a desperate bid to wrest back control and save the union.

Prelle challenges the norms and is used to doing what she wants. But at the same time, she is caught between her own dreams, the expectations of the outside world and harsh realities. The debut director Anita Beikpour has therefore mixed the forms to be able to draw a full portrait of the young rapper and nonconformist. Music video, fiction and raw realism go side by side in a cinematic tale of a rebel's internal and external struggles.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/1/1/1/4/8/611148-prelle-in-my-own-voice-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=28af527579"},{"name":"Les Enfoirs 2020 - Le Pari(s) des Enfoirs","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/8/9/3/5/6/589356-les-enfoires-2020-le-pari-s-des-enfoires-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=a795dc193a"},{"name":"Violet Gibson, the Irish Woman Who Shot Mussolini","tagline":"","description":"The true and forgotten story of Violet Gibson, daughter of the Lord Chancellor to Ireland, who shot fascist dictator Benito Mussolini at point-blank range as she faced a Fascist mob in Rome in 1926.
