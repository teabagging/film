In this exhilarating waltz through his life, Kirk takes us from a working-class childhood in Carlisle to interviewing the stars of the 80s pop scene, accompanied by a marvellously eclectic soundtrack written especially for the film. A Boy Called Mary was made for Channel 4s landmark series Six of Hearts, exploring gay and lesbian lives in the 1980s through a mix of documentary interviews and re-enacted scenes. Kirk is a refreshingly candid guide through the gay scene of the 70s and 80s, not holding back on his loathing of Thatcher and his dislike of working at Gay News. In the years following the broadcast of A Boy Called Mary, Kirk continued to write, including the landmark essay A Descent into Darkness in 1992, about the blindness that resulted from his AIDS diagnosis. He died the following year.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Courage to Change","tagline":"","description":"This feature documentary is a sequel to the 1966 documentary The Things I Cannot Change, which, by focusing on the Bailey family of Montreal, provided an anatomy of poverty in North America.

Wolff traces the source of the economic crisis to the 1970s, when wages began to stagnate and American workers were forced into a dysfunctional spiral of borrowing and debt that ultimately exploded in the mortgage meltdown. By placing the crisis within this larger historical and systemic frame, Wolff argues convincingly that the proposed government \\"bailouts,\\" stimulus packages, and calls for increased market regulation will not be enough to address the real causes of the crisis, in the end suggesting that far more fundamental change will be necessary to avoid future catastrophes.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/2/6/0/3/3/226033-capitalism-hits-the-fan-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=6fb53ec578"},{"name":"Frank Edge Jr","tagline":"I think I made a mistake","description":"A dark and dreary character study of a serial killer.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/6/9/8/8/9/869889-frank-edge-jr-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=3806adec6b"},{"name":"L'ora d'amore","tagline":"","description":"\\"The Love Hour\\" is a film about confines, the complex barriers that make love relationships impossible.

The story of a boy from an ordinary family whose ambition was to become an artist, but who instead became a drifter.  His destiny, however, was not to drift, but to rise to the greatest heights of power, eventually becoming one of the most influential men who ever lived.  Now for the first time, here is a documented account of a story many believe to be The Greatest Story NEVER Told! This ground-breaking documentary chronicles the rise of Germany from defeat in World War I, to communist attempts to take over Germany, hyperinflation during the Weimar Republic, widespread unemployment and misery, and Adolf Hitlers rise to power. It also reveals the personal side of Adolf Hitler: who he was, his family background, his artwork and struggles in Vienna, and what motivated him to come to power.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/6/0/9/7/1/1160971-adolf-hitler-the-greatest-story-never-told--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=cd319929d5"},{"name":"Men with Beards","tagline":"","description":"Men with Beards is a feature documentary that weaves a strange tale of beauty and brotherhood.

When tribes meet, instead of attacking each other with hatchets and knives, they battle over which Chief has the prettiest suit. Director Aaron Walker's 5-year-long intimate entry into this often hidden New Orleans experience also reveals other battles the Chiefs face every day: harassment by the police, gentrification of their neighborhoods, disinterested youth, old age, and natural disaster.
