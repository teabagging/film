Re-contextualized in disproportionately large proportions within landscapes seen from afar, these objects stand out like the ruins of monumental architecture. The absence of life as well as the luminous atmosphere of the work create a tension between apocalyptic feeling and nostalgia, between precious object and waste, between idealized nature and the indelible presence of human traces.

Only a few animals can match the elegance of these feline predators. The cautious hunters are rarely seen in the wild for more than a few seconds. The cats can be observed more extensively when they rest asleep in a tree and recover from the mostly nocturnal hunt. But a leopardess has switched to hunting in broad daylight. Its home along the brook bed of the Olare Orok offers everything a mother needs to protect and nourish its offspring: picturesque rocks and dense bush, a landscape in which the big cat can disappear in seconds to sneak up on potential prey, which includes warthogs and antelopes. But hyenas and lions are always ready to contest for its territory and nourishment. The renowned wildlife filmmaker Reinhard Radke managed to capture astonishing insights into the social life and hunting tactics of the ambush hunters in the Maasai Mara.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/9/8/3/6/0/698360-die-leopardin-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=3947e6b1ae"},{"name":"The legend of Agatha Rose","tagline":"","description":"She lurks in the closet, hiding behind clothes, waiting to take the child she chose...","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/2/9/4/0/5/1029405-the-legend-of-agatha-rose-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=70b05e6968"},{"name":"Greedgeist - Down The Rabbit Hole","tagline":"","description":"Greedgeist looks at our relationship with money and the manifestation of greed in our culture, all seen through the camera lens of journalists from around the world.
