Featuring behind the scenes access following the restoration process, this documentary charts five extraordinary years which saw the Glasgow School of Art make headlines around the world.

Perhaps you have a loved one who is caught in one of those false systems. Perhaps you have tried everything to change their mind, but to no avail.  Snatch Them from the Flames will help you to approach your lost loved one with a better understanding of why they are clinging to a false  version of Christianity.  Todd Friel and Justin Peters tackle:  1. Why your loved one is attracted to these movements. 2. What we can learn about them and ourselves from that. 3. What you can say or do to persuade them to escape to true Christianity.  Save others, snatching them out of the fire; and on some have mercy with fear (Jude 23).","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/5/2/8/7/4/552874-snatch-them-from-the-flames-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=c98bb67c04"},{"name":"G?mb?c vitz","tagline":"","description":"A round warrior sets out on a quest to fill the world with color","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/8/9/0/6/4/989064-gomboc-vitez-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=6ccb5a507f"},{"name":"Das Geheimnis der dunklen Energie","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/3/9/5/9/8/539598-das-geheimnis-der-dunklen-energie-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=efd9645985"},{"name":"Dave Matthews & Tim Reynolds - Farm Aid","tagline":"","description":"Dave and Tim to Perform at Farm Aid 2018.

Apart from Black to Blues, an EP that gives a number of blues classics a BSC makeover, there is also their 5th studio album Kentucky (2016). Whereas Magic Mountain (2014) was somewhat heavier than its predecessors, Kentucky is more versatile and showcases the full spectrum of Black Stone Cherrys songwriting abilities.

In 1942, the Germans quickly built sixteen giant coastal artillery batteries along the French coast. The precision and force of some of them meant they could wipe out any English vessel at sea, and even reach the British coast. Churchill, in a panic over the power of these guns, in turn ordered the building of six batteries atop the cliffs of Dover.

In 2013, a young man in Florida was literally \\"swallowed up by the earth\\" when a cesspool suddenly opened up under his bedroom. The film's main setting is a bedroom by night. From the way it was shot, the viewer has the feeling of peering into an abandoned life-size dollhouse. Other sequences show close-up views of a young man lying on a bed with a tormented look on his face or cowering in a corner. The scene is accompanied by an exaggeratedly romantic song whose refrain C \\"It took me so long to get my feet back off the ground\\" C alludes to the loss of a loved one and a sense of abysmal loneliness. The song's emotionality contrasts starkly with the artificiality of the scene. The boundary between reproduction and reality grows fluid, and the virtuality C which the artist has carried to a near- perfect extreme C begins to crumble in view of the protagonist's physical and emotional frailty.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/8/1/0/1/1/1181011-hisser-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=e1665badfe"},{"name":"Nous : La face cache de nos transports","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/9/3/6/6/9/693669-nous-la-face-cachee-de-nos-transports-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=65fc4209cf"},{"name":"Damon at 86th Street","tagline":"Damon C.
