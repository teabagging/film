In this gentle, prismatic film, Samara returns to the town she fled as a teen to re-immerse herself in the memories still lurking there, in its spaces and within the dusty boxes of diaries, photos and VHS tapes. 1999 is not a ghost story, but the ghosts are palpable at every turn. The snow-covered streets, the school's hallways and lockers are preserved as in a dream. The absences left by the relentless teenage suicides still shimmer with questions, trauma and regret. Samara encounters people who are as breathtaking as they are heartbroken, and, finally, 16 years later, the community strengthens itself by sharing the long-silenced memories. Ultimately the film weaves together multiple voices in a collective essay on how grief is internalized-and how, as children, we so painfully learn to articulate our desire to stay alive.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/9/3/0/8/9/793089-1999-wish-you-were-here-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=e53577ecef"},{"name":"Keep Believing","tagline":"","description":"Frans Baartmans left his home on the Netherlands in 1979 to live in India amongst the Dalits in the slums of Nagwa, Varanasi.

The strong cast includes the marvellously expressive miracle Dorothea R?schmann (Die Zeit) and Michael Schade, who exudes his exceptional tenor in Fierrabrass heroic arias (Der neue Merker).

The pieces made their way by rail to the lake and the boat was reassembled. This film is in the same class as Fred Wiseman's early work as it takes us on board this creaking ferry which becomes a metaphor for Africa itself.
