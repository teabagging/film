In contrast to the fatalism of one, the other argues that the ruins are a shelter for organising a common life and breaking the cycle of political disillusionment. Oscillating between cinema of the real and futuristic speculation, the work leads us into a poetic and political reflection on the mutations of the world.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"SelfSymbol","tagline":"","description":"\\"This film is a collaborative installation project with Orleans + Winder (Detroit).

Construction commenced in 1888 and was overseen by 22-year-old civil engineer John Monash, who ensured it was constructed on time and on budget, despite government inefficiencies. Opening in sections in the early 1890s, the line serviced few passengers and much of it closed within two years.

Every town had a gas works, where gas was processed from the coal, and every gas works included a large storage device, a telescopic metal drum, often contained within an iron framework. Most of these were constructed between 1860 and 1890. The Gasometers in this film have now been removed and part of the removal process is documented in the film. However, my primary interest with the film is in terms of the way they filter, reflect, refract and break up the light that falls on them.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Hai Lah Menantu","tagline":"","description":"A lady seeks a bride for her son","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Havana's Heart & Beats","tagline":"","description":"Film from Claudio Del Punta","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"House Date","tagline":"","description":"Charlie hosts a Jessica at his home hoping to progress their relationship, but the date goes terribly wrong when they are interrupted by an unusual force.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Il Martello, il Coltello e la Pietra","tagline":"","description":"This short film was shot between January and March 2015 in several Sardinian villages.

The first are slightly wayward, yet adored by their families and subject to the usual anxieties and aspirations of their ethnic minority community. The second are social outcasts from the same homes who have criminal tendencies. When the actions of these two antagonistic groups bring them into conflict on the streets, the results are explosive. Produced and financed by London's Ragam Productions, this blend of thriller and social drama draws on the capital's Tamil community for its cast and technicians. Thanks to its unique insight, 'Siva Senai' paints a powerful and authentic picture of the social pressures on Tamil youths in the UK. It also explores the consequences for law-abiding parents and other ordinary citizens of troubled inner city areas.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"On Tour: The Waterboys","tagline":"","description":"The Waterboys, led by Mike Scott, is said to defy genre.

Atop its summit sits the monastery of Santa Maria, which houses the famous \\"Black Madonna\\", La Moreneta, a holy object which has drawn pilgrims since the 12th century.  The Llibre Vermell (\\"Red Book\\") is a collection of music, hymns, writings and much more that has been the crown of the monastery's archives for centuries, and it is music from that which Savall and his team perform here.  The music was written to be danced in the church or the cloisters. This performance gives us an insight into medieval Christianity that is all but unique, and it's cherishable if for nothing other than historical reasons. The polyphony is early, and modest, but the choir of La Capella Reial sing it with seriousness and disarming simplicity.
