The only problem is that the city is all the way across the Russian steppes, and at this time in history, that arduous journey could only be undertaken by horse and carriage. Reminiscent of the American pioneer wagon trains heading West, the tale lacks any attacks from hostile forces but is filled with charming vignettes. In one part of the journey, the boy comes across some fishermen along a river, harpooning their catch for the day. In another segment, he is entertained when some folk dancers do a lively show.

Shot on location at the iconic Rivoli Ballroom in South London, Clowns is a 30 minute film unlike anything audiences will have seen before.  Directed, choreographed and composed by Hofesh Shechter, Clowns features 10 of his world class dancers playing out a macabre comedy of murder and desire, and asks: how far will we go in the name of entertainment?  The piece combines Hofeshs bold, exhilarating and tribal choreography with a percussive, cinematic score and the camera gets up close to the exceptionally talented ensemble of dancers.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/1/3/4/8/6/613486-clowns-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=3bc2439620"},{"name":"Elevation","tagline":"","description":"The plot is being kept under wraps, but the story is said to follow a single father and two women who must venture from the safety of their home to face monstrous creatures in order to save the life of a child.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Carta a una se?orita en Pars","tagline":"","description":"A letter about the persistence of ghosts, the incomprehensibility of the past and its traces in the present.

Though never formally trained he has only learned techniques of wrestling by observing others. As a Brahmin he is required to study Vedas yet he is deeply interested in martial arts. Ranga Jetti, the premier wrestler in Kanchi, takes him under his wing and trains him. One day while observing the training of Pallava princes Mayura gets into a fight with and thrashes Vishnugopa, the Pallava prince, earning his enmity.  Mayura has to flee Kanchi as per the advice of Ranga Jetti to escape from pursuing Pallavas. He also then learns that he is in fact the son of Raja Chandravarma, the Kadamba king who was deceitfully killed by the Pallava king, Sivaskandhavarma. Upon learning of his illustrious lineage, Mayura dedicates himself to overthrow the Pallava yoke. Returning to Banavasi in the guise of a merchant Mayura builds an army and conquers both Banavasi and the Telugu speaking regions around Srishaila, thus building a vast kingdom.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/6/5/2/4/0/165240-mayura-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=4b9c2f5afe"},{"name":"Matt Helm","tagline":"","description":"In this pilot film for the later series, a former secret agent, now a private investigator, is hired to protect a beautiful film star and gets involved with black marketeers and gun runners.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/5/1/7/2/8/451728-matt-helm-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=55f12b7311"},{"name":"Legend of the Sex Thief in Edo","tagline":"","description":"Nikkatsu Roman Porno","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/6/4/1/8/3/164183-legend-of-the-sex-thief-in-edo-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=cfffd4cc03"},{"name":"Warmth of Love","tagline":"","description":"Roman Porno from 1972.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/6/4/1/3/3/164133-warmth-of-love-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=6534213a57"},{"name":"Satan's Harvest","tagline":"","description":"Cutter Murdock inherits an estate in Africa on which \\"Satan's Harvest\\" (heroin and marijuana) is grown.
