Recital is a highly structured film. Each section involves a woman, situated in some external local, reading a letter or other text. It is clear that the women are not the authors of what they read. The first text is a letter expressing the pain of unrequited love, the abyss of frustrated passion, however read in a monotone with no peaks of feeling. This pattern of love letter reading is repeated with several other readers: one breaks up laughing when she comes to a passage: 'Oh, yes, I love you, I love you.' Clearly the subject is not one of true comedy, particularly since the letters recited are ones Beroes once earnestly composed. Beroes' goal, however, is a kind of distanced deconstruction of the experience, in an attempt to view it with the lessons of knowledge and time.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/5/3/2/6/6/253266-recital-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=86429ccf4b"},{"name":"Malik","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/1/8/3/5/3/518353-malik-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=0025d3ea98"},{"name":"Nazanin","tagline":"","description":"Nayyerr is an orphan girl who is taken care of by her old aunt Effat, and she is pregnant by a young man named Morteza.

Four of the tracks come from the album Machine Head which had been released earlier that year.  The album was at first seen as somewhat unimportant by the band members, and only Roger Glover and Ian Paice showed up to mix it.  The release in the US was delayed, until April 1973, because Warner Bros. wanted to release Who Do We Think We Are first. The three concerts recorded were later released as Live in Japan 3-CD box set (1993). According to the liner notes for that set, unlike many live albums, there are no overdubs or studio additions to the original album.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/3/2/6/8/1/132681-deep-purple-made-in-japan-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=4b0f087a30"},{"name":"On The Docks","tagline":"","description":"Adaptation of a lesser known to Western world, yet wildly popular Peking Opera developed during the Cultural Revolution under the leadership of Jiang Qing.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/8/5/2/9/1/285291-on-the-docks-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=25b9cc510b"},{"name":"Chronicles: Morocco","tagline":"","description":"The Chronicles capture the natural and cultural beauty of Morocco from its ancient walled villages to its nomadic caravans. Music comes from everywhere. Edited almost thirty years apart, the two Chronicles together are a study in Auder's approach to his memories. The footage is all from the same trip that was a family vacation.  Considering Chronicles/Morocco, 1971 a construct of emotional convenience unfaithful to memory, Auder decided to supplement the first version with a fuller account. The two works feature almost entirely different footage. There are, however, sections where one can see where Auder has omitted Viva. The star of the 1971 version is a young Moroccan Adonis who appoints himself tour-guide for a group of Europeans including Michel. The camera follows his charming antics as he flaunts his nubile body and rather blunt but effective skills as a hunter.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Cider with Rosie","tagline":"","description":"An enchanting tale of childhood in a sleepy Cotswold village during and immediately after the First World War.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/2/1/3/5/5/221355-cider-with-rosie-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=1c77f279fa"},{"name":"A Hole Lot of Trouble","tagline":"","description":"Three workmen assigned to dig a hole in a road for an electrical cable run into problems with local officials who believe the hole is being dug in the wrong place and should be closer to the home of a prissy fashion designer.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/7/2/6/7/8/272678-a-hole-lot-of-trouble-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=caf23a5f9d"},{"name":"The Happy Organ","tagline":"","description":"Experimental short film preserved by the Academy Film Archive in 2017.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Witch","tagline":"","description":"Delusions dominate Souad's mind and she believes that she can be with the person she loves through magic, so she puts a piece of sugar for her boyfriend that she brought from one of the charlatans in his cup of tea","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/5/4/0/1/9/754019-witch-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=e86c1901ef"},{"name":"Film Ambiente","tagline":"","description":"Film installation by Marinella Pirelli.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/6/5/4/4/6/865446-film-ambiente-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=05cf9afc8c"},{"name":"Eden Cried","tagline":"In the fall of '55...

Each student has his own style and character - often chosen for maximum dramatic impact. For instance, Paul is permanently gloomy, and mopes around, invariably wearing a long coat. The others make fun of him, because he is so serious. Charly loyally helps a male friend of hers rid himself of the insistent attentions of a former girlfriend. Caroline is the romantic one of the bunch, and her adventures along those lines keep her fully occupied. Several of them insist that they will not compromise the purity of their cinematic and theatrical aspirations for mere monetary comfort, but when Luc and Nanou find that Nanou is pregnant, they reconsider their absolutist stance.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/2/2/9/3/8/322938-grand-bonheur-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=262a77dda4"},{"name":"Haut-Saut","tagline":"","description":"The story of a ski jumper who pricks himself from Olympus ...","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/3/8/3/6/0/638360-haut-saut-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=5f14052cef"},{"name":"My Dog Zero","tagline":"","description":"A man's quest to overcome high expectations when it came to finding a perfect canine companion.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/0/4/8/3/6/404836-my-dog-zero-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=745844f622"},{"name":"In Search of Our Fathers","tagline":"","description":"Williams, who was raised by his mother and aunt, had been trying for months to get his mother to talk about his father, whom he had never met and knew nothing about.
