The Cambodian nation is still recovering after the genocide in the seventies where a quarter of the nation was executed. The social infrastructure is in ruins and corruption is severe. One fifth of the nation is illiterate and poverty drives children to work instead of attending school. Half the nation lives under the poverty line and earns less than a dollar a day. Poor families in the remote rural areas are the most vulnerable to the trafficking and we follow the fortunes of one such family.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/8/6/8/3/8/986838-children-for-sale-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=1688343106"},{"name":"Eine Begegnung mit Marcel Reich-Ranicki","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Maso","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Kikker in de Wolken","tagline":"","description":"Registration of the second musical about Kikker (Frog).

This charming, anarchic film is simultaneously tension-filled, beautiful and inspirational. No-one can fail to be moved by the trials which the three adventurers face while negotiating the subcontinent's grandest and most dramatic scenery.  The idea giving rise to the film is to draw on Mike's legendary flying skills to transport Marianne and James to three of Southern Africa's wildest and most remote rock walls, which they will then climb, while documenting the proceedings on camera. Events, however, seldom turn out exactly as expected.  The resulting film, full of the warmth of Africa, is an object lesson in intrepid friendship and contemporary free-spiritedness, set to a kwela soundtrack.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/7/1/8/3/2/171832-no-need-for-parking-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=16975289a8"},{"name":"Anne Roumanoff  Bobino","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/7/1/6/1/8/271618-anne-roumanoff-a-bobino-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=e8bf910248"},{"name":"Granny boom","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/2/6/8/4/6/726846-granny-boom-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=d641a27f03"},{"name":"Marie-laine Thibert: En Spectacle","tagline":"","description":"The French Quebecker singer Marie-laine Thibert in her first tour, recorded live on stage in 2006.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/8/6/4/8/9/586489-marie-elaine-thibert-en-spectacle-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=1d1b824ee7"},{"name":"Mrs. Stone: Looking for the Light in All the Dark Corners","tagline":"","description":"The making of the film with Donald Spoto.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Once in a Blue Moon","tagline":"","description":"Directed bu Sue Healey.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/4/9/9/1/7/449917-once-in-a-blue-moon-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=188ca09bf9"},{"name":"House Of Shakira: Live At Firefest 2005","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/4/3/6/1/9/743619-house-of-shakira-live-at-firefest-2005-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=bd0ca35368"},{"name":"Und ich lieb dich doch!","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Nox - Ragyogs - Koncert","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/6/6/5/3/2/566532-nox-ragyogas-koncert-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=0ef07578f7"},{"name":"Murcof, Erik Truffaz & Talvin Singh - Montreux Jazz Festival","tagline":"","description":"Murcof, Erik Truffaz and Talvin Singh live at the 2006 Montreux Jazz festival.

Vysotsky struggled with death for a long time. But by the beginning of 1980, this duel turned into a fierce fight. After 25 years, we present the first documentary evidence of this struggle. Everyone has the right to their own judgment about the death of a great poet, but no one's judgment can claim absolute truth. According to eyewitnesses, after the meeting of the new 1980, Vysotsky's disease began to progress and turned into a real agony. We will reconstruct the events with chronological accuracy from January 1 up to July 25, 1980.

While Curren came to power in the mid 80's with back to back World Titles, he became a legend in 1990. Ater a three year hiatus he reappeared and started from scratch, dominating the world of pro surfing in a way that can never be repeated. It's hard to pinpoint why Curren's legacy outweighs even his three incredible titles. Kelly Slater has long, since passed him and others like Andy Irons have matched it. Maybe it's the fact that Curren won al his titles in front o huge crowds instead of on remote reefs. Perhaps its his reluctant hero appeal that adds to his mystique. Or maybe its the fact that to this day he still holds the record for more tour victories over any other surfer... even Slater.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/2/1/3/4/4/921344-curren-trials-to-title-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=1007077245"},{"name":"Dancing on the Rainbow","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/9/8/2/7/5/798275-dancing-on-the-rainbow-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=7593384bd5"},{"name":"Das Schwert der Samurai","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/3/4/3/4/5/634345-das-schwert-der-samurai-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=3550ba9dc9"},{"name":"Det var en g?ng en skog...","tagline":"","description":"On January 8, 2005, the storm Gudrun pulled over southern Sweden and large parts of the Sm?land forest blew down.

However, not all of the world is particularly friendly to its inhabitants for this is also a planet of extremes: blistering deserts, barren mountain peaks, bleak icy wastelands and dark places that rarely see the sun. In the freezing world of the Arctic, the polar bear is equipped with a coat of fur and blubber designed to cope in a land where winters seem interminable. High altitude mountain ranges also present problems for animals. Mountain goats need to cope with the thin air and treacherous terrain found above the snow line. Life in the desert is a constant battle against a lack of water. The saguaro cactus can expand sufficiently to absorb a ton of water a day when the rains come. In the deepest, darkest caves, freetail bats have developed extraordinarily sensitive hearing. Finally, in the mysterious deep of our oceans, fragile jellyfish are gelatinous enough to thrive in water pressure that would crush most creatures.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"The Woman And The Hornet","tagline":"","description":"Salwa is a wealthy woman whose husbands keep dying for different reasons.

Finally, the adventurers set off from Patriot Hills Base Camp on the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf to the Pole. The completely different character traits of the two men quickly emerge. Messner is impetuous and pushes for speed. The calm Fuchs divides his strength and consistently follows his pace during all planned breaks. On New Year's Eve 1989, the two men are warmly welcomed by the crew of the US Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station.

Later it was staged also in Firenze (October 86), Perugia (April 87) and finally in Palermo (June 87, part of the collective exhibition Per amor del Cielo at the Modern Art Gallery).  The installation is an ever-changing landscape of memories dedicated: to the black island, where a beloved shipwrecked friend, after having suffered for a long time has been turned into a fish.  The theme of the work is the shipwreck in all of its allegorical meanings. Mixing music, electronic images, voices, scenographic materials, GMM re-proposes the poetic reconstruction of a seascape populated by fishermen, castaways, wrecks, hallucinated backgrounds.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/4/9/7/6/2/1049762-movimenti-sul-fondo-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=1609f3ce7d"},{"name":"New Tales of Scheherazade","tagline":"The film follows the adventures of a shoemaker Maruf, Gina, emerging out of the bottle, wise caliphs, viziers treacherous and bloodthirsty pirates.","description":"The film follows the adventures of a shoemaker Maruf, Gina, emerging out of the bottle, wise caliphs, viziers treacherous and bloodthirsty pirates.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/4/3/9/6/7/243967-new-tales-of-scheherazade-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=31fd5eaf3b"},{"name":"Piyangocu K?z","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/1/1/6/5/5/1011655-piyangocu-kz-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=100d9407fe"},{"name":"Pookalai Parikathirgal","tagline":"","description":"Film with a soundtrack featuring the music of S.
