In King-Cat, John beautifully renders the \\"in-between moments\\" - those instances which occupy the bulk of our lives, but can pass easily without notice: Sitting on the front porch. Peeing at a rest stop. Watching a bird. With humor, compassion and a keen eye, John shows readers what they might be missing, and in doing so inspires many to embrace life more fully. Born of the zine revolution of the late eighties/early nineties, King-Cat today is the template for cartoonists who seek to create work that is personal, well-crafted and free of outside influence.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/7/4/8/9/3/474893-root-hog-or-die-a-film-about-john-porcellino-and-king-cat-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=3ee962aa31"},{"name":"Salt","tagline":"","description":"A lonesome boy who has just moved to a small fishing village loses his innocence as a mysterious girl he just met has a tragic accident.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/5/5/7/1/8/255718-salt-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=b315561062"},{"name":"Gone South: How Canada Invented Hollywood","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/4/2/7/6/2/842762-gone-south-how-canada-invented-hollywood-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=7ad4b5e546"},{"name":"After Rave","tagline":"","description":"Milda is planning to spend a night with her friends, but the news of her grampa's death slowly sets in.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/9/8/4/1/4/898414-after-rave-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=c03eb8a0ba"},{"name":"Blood And Ink","tagline":"","description":"While tattoos can be found on people in almost every country in the world, few know the history behind this ancient form of body modification.

Desmond's dancing ditty, \\"Take Five\\" is rendered in a faster tempo than the studio version. Brubeck's ragtime-flavoured \\"(It's a) Raggy Waltz,\\" highlights his percussive piano lines, while \\"Castillian Blues\\" and the Turkish strains of \\"Blue Rondo a la Turk\\" reveal his multicultural, compositional genius. Gleason, the show's creator and host, was a well-respected, San Francisco-based jazz critic and author.

Shot in the USA, Central America, Australia, and Indonesia, the film celebrates surfing exploits while keeping an eye on the darker side of things. Ojeda, who shot and edited the film himself, revels in spectacular scenes of sunsets on the beach, sunlight glinting on foam, and heart-stopping shots of the chiseled bodies of pro surfers gliding through the waves. At the same time, he provides glimpses into the poverty that exists next to the glorious beaches, and hints at political violence simmering just under the surface. Super 16mm film, with its grainy texture, lens flares, and painterly depth of field, lends the film a nostalgic feel, while off-screen dialog and statements keep it in the 'here and now'.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/7/7/8/5/4/577854-free-jazz-vein-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=e564c14a02"},{"name":"Caf, um Dedo de Prosa","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/2/4/6/1/6/424616-cafe-um-dedo-de-prosa-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=f31816c37a"},{"name":"200 Miles","tagline":"","description":"200 Miles is the inspiring story of ultra-marathoner, Eric Gelber, who attempted to run a record 200 miles around New York's Central Park to raise awareness and $1 million dollars for the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF).","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/5/5/3/9/7/655397-200-miles-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=92c34b2ee6"},{"name":"Joe Finds Grace","tagline":"A GLOVE STORY","description":"Simple-minded Joseph Briteman breaks a golden rule of his 'life skills' program when he walks away unsupervised to rescue his long lost baby sister.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/3/3/2/0/4/433204-joe-finds-grace-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=e5b94101f6"},{"name":"John Steinbeck's USA","tagline":"","description":"In 1960, aboard his motor home Rocinante, writer John Steinbeck and his poodle Charley roamed through the United States of America for eleven weeks thirty four states, almost 10,000 miles, trying to understand the mind and soul of its inhabitants.
