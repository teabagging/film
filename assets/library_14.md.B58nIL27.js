The visual organization of this barely recognizable representational surface is resolved through Takeshi Fumimoto's musical structure. The images illustrate neither the tone nor the rhythm; they follow the logic of the acoustic blueprint to create new forms of hearing through the processing of the found sounds. The camera makes a parallel searching movement along the rough surface. The images, which cannot be isolated, resist a representational aesthetic, and fleeting spatial landscapes and forms which illustrate non-repeatability and improvisation appear in the tension between concentration on the cracks and fractures and the camera's movement across them. Reduction to the plastic and sensorial basis sensitizes the viewer's gaze by making the structure comprehensible.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/6/6/8/6/6/466866-o-t--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=4639c55c2b"},{"name":"The Canterville Ghost","tagline":"","description":"'The Canterville Ghost' is one of the most popular choice for making a film in Oscar Wilde's works, and the original short story deserves the popularity.

A new victim had also had his teeth pulled. Then they see a man who looks like the sheriff at the scene. Takeshi says that all the adults in the town are the enemy, and scares Mamoru by telling him that when it really hurts, he can't even speak. Takeshi grabs a slingshot and tries to attack the sheriff, looking as if he is possessed by something. Eventually, Mamoru discovers something unexpected in Takeshi's house...  The two boys are played by women, which makes the film seem like a fantasy, but don't underestimate the suspense, which is carefully calculated. The camerawork for the climax, the action scene in the attic, is also very good. The tempo of the action in the first half of the film is so good that it is shown in one go.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/4/7/6/3/7/847637--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=78ce6205d9"},{"name":"The Amphibian","tagline":"","description":"In a dark subterranean landscape, the Amphibian has lost its way.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/6/2/6/8/2/762682-the-amphibian-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=24ba77981b"},{"name":"Uzla?ma","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/2/7/3/1/5/227315-uzlasma-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=b4717bb58c"},{"name":"Peter Gabriel - POV","tagline":"","description":"An all-Gabriel performance featuring some of Gabriel's own 8mm work, personal footage from the two Amnesty International tours, a trip he took to the USSR and even home movies.
