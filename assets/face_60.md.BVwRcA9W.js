The water people, by contrast, have never lived with men: they are the creators and owners of the rivers and creeks, controlling the state of the waters and the abundance of fish. The little village of Soku, hidden in the heart of the eastern Delta, has a group of heroes headed by Fenibaso, and its creeks and rivers are controlled by the water-spirit Duminea.

In showing you the job as a hostess, the film travels off lot to other parts of the world which, I'm positive, look very different nowadays. Grace sings in this film also, especially the song \\"Calypso\\", which I remember fondly from what I believe is Tsai Ming Liang's best film \\"The Hole\\". Althgough it has a few plot twists, its mostly a feel good film, and when Ms. Chang smiles, she is gorgeous. If its little fluffy, I like it more for it.

It also tells the story of two friends - conservationist and director Sandy Crichton, and 88-year-old wildlife photographer George Chance. Bound by their mutual love and admiration for the falcons, Chance's failing health and eyesight inspires the young Crichton to capture footage of the falcons as a tribute to the latter's body of work from the 1970's. What begins as an empathetic response to fulfil a friend's final wish to see the magnificent birds on film ends up becoming the chance of a lifetime. When Crichton begins filming the falcons, he inadvertently becomes witness to new falcon behaviour, capturing a turning point in the ecological evolution of the wild birds.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/5/2/9/8/3/152983-karearea-the-pine-falcon-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=c1d8ec99b0"},{"name":"Kasey Chambers: Behind The Barricades","tagline":"","description":"'Behind The Barricades' is a look into Kasey Chambers - on and off stage - spanning six years.
