The Jenin camp was established in 1953, in order to provide shelter for Palestinians dispersed and expelled from their homes after the formation of Israel in 1948. The inhabitants of this camp resist resettling in order to keep their dispersed status, as to relinquish it would be to relinquish their claim upon their native home. As a result they have no political representation, rights, or status.

The obvious step is to regard his observations of the city and its inhabitants as urban portraits, but the films are too subtle for that. Often they were shot spontaneously in a single location, street or district, but beyond the deceptive simplicity is another way of looking (and filming) that in a certain sense seems to be torn free of reality. Is not the city itself that is seen through the camera, but the light that the city reflects: filtered and purified and put on 16mm film. A stream of light and dark areas, shifting and mirrored surfaces and peep holes, filled with details and rhythm, and often edited in the camera. That the films have no sound amplifies the feeling of rootlessness.

This woman also suffers from the hostility of her job, isolation and loneliness, and in many cases, discrimination. And the third, the domestic worker by the day, on whom the hardest work falls and who is totally unprotected especially in old age. In all three modalities work has no social recognition. Women are classified as economically inactive, alongside the disabled and beggars.

The artistic roots of these seven artists can be found in Martha Graham's concern with modern life as a subject for dance and in Merce Cunningham's emphasis on the nature of movement. In the 1960s, the interaction of art forms generated choreographic innovations. Especially influential was John Cage, whose radical ideas served as a point of departure for much of the new choreography. Each of the choreographers in Making Dances draws inspiration from the Graham/Cunningham tradition, yet each makes a highly distinctive statement. Structure, movement in non-fictive time and space, and the nature of movement itself are recurring themes.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/3/8/7/0/0/638700-making-dances-seven-post-modern-choreographers-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=e92e591fb4"},{"name":"Steppin'","tagline":"","description":"At the end of the 70s there was a vigorous fight for socialism in Jamaica.
