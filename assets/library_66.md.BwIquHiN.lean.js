Through Lenox's eyes, ears and encounters with Kool Keith and Cam'ron, the film presents an innocent entry point into the idolized and often explicit world of hip hop. It reconsiders the age-old parental advisory debate and realities of a kid growing up in an adult world. As Skip confronts criticism about his intentions and parenting, Lenox remains unfazed. He isn't listening to any of it. In his world, art is 'medium important' compared to school, Lego's and Minecraft.

However, in the animation scenes several different photo cameras were used: a Canon 50D for instance, which was fitted with a self-made telephoto lens made of cardboard; a cardboard pinhole camera; a large-format Sinar camera 4x5 inches and a small-format reflex cameras Nikon FM and Canon 5D.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/4/3/8/5/3/343853-apparitions-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=9b3d4042f1"},{"name":"Eidola","tagline":"","description":"'Eidola' references an early intromission theory of vision, that all things emit tiny versions of themselves into our eyes. That theory competed at the time with the emission theory, that the eyes themselves emitted light, which emerged from the eyes and sent back to the mind what was seen. In this piece we see through eyes that emit an infrared light to which the raw film is insensitive while touching the camera's retina with an external light which it can 'see'. We move from the un-lensed eye along the film path (optical nerve) into the magazine containing the film in the process of its exposure (the mind). As we do so there is a growing lapse between the performed light and the moment we see it in the video because we are traveling further from the 'eye' (memory).","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/3/7/3/2/0/737320-eidola-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=50e1e281ab"},{"name":"The Frozen Chosen","tagline":"","description":"Each winter a monstrous beast lures men and women to the ice of Lake Winnebago.

Through stories retold by painters, tatto artisits, barbers and other coloful characters we get the picture of a vibrant multi-ethnic neighborhood where people struggled to survive, get along and move ahead, at a time when real estate development and gentrification has started to push the low income housing residents away for the benefit of affluent professionals. Featuring a number of known people as themselves: John MIchael Boyer, Griffin Dunne, Lloyd Kaufmann, Charlie Sheen, Mira Sorvino, Ivy Supersonic and more. The film concludes with a revisit to the Hell's Kitchen of 2007, where the redevelopment transformation has all but been complete.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/7/6/5/3/7/176537-hell-s-kitchen-a-new-york-neighborhood-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=e58b30e7e3"},{"name":"Ball","tagline":"","description":"The life story of one ball.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/1/8/8/6/4/818864--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=7b8fd19cbe"},{"name":"Jumpcut","tagline":"","description":"Two pieces of found footage were used to produce Jumpcut: a series of frames cut from the head and tails of various takes of a talking head shot for a 1970s industrial film or commercial; and a piece of 1950s/60s home movie footage depicting a jumping child interrupted by the perforation marks at the end of the reel.

Enjoy endless ramblings from the foul-mouthed squirrel, Foamy, and inane laments from Germaine, the Goth chick that must endure Foamy on a daily basis.....a fate worse than death.
