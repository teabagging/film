Each of the operas, influenced by Verdi's political involvement in the Risorgimento for the reunification of Italy during the period, are very much concerned with the exercise of power, but they all rely on typically operatic conventions of bel canto and French Grand Opra in their use of personal tragedies and unlikely twists of fate to highlight the human feelings and weaknesses that lie behind their historical dramas. Written in 1859, but revised by the composer in 1881, Piave's libretto given an uncredited reworking by Arrigo Boito, Simon Boccanegra is consequently one of the more interesting works from this period, certainly from a musical standpoint.

He doesn't seem to be suffering from the threat of death closing in on him. With unbridled energy, he parties, smokes, drinks and dances until deep into the night, and in the morning wakes up in bed next to girls he doesn't even know. His family and friends alienate from him because of this life style, and the fact that he doesn't have long lasting relationships, doesn't bother him. Olivier lives, day by day. Until new medical technologies make it possible to cure him, and a new future opens up to him. Everybody is happy, but Olivier doesn't know how to deal with the expectations and responsibilities of his new life.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/8/2/8/6/6/382866-olivier-etc--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=38436a05d8"},{"name":"Afrika, mon amour","tagline":"","description":"Berlin, 1914: When Katharina von Strahlberg discovers that her husband Richard had an affair with her sister-in-law Martha, she leaves him after stealing some important plans and photos of East Africa and travels to Dar es Salaam with one of Richard's business partners.

Through his fluid, sensual manipulation of sound and visuals, Seaman distills water to its most elemental form.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/1/8/5/0/8/618508-the-water-catalogue-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=3be70fc7aa"},{"name":"Children of Strife","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/4/9/1/6/5/749165-deti-razdorov-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=a70f709727"},{"name":"Portrait of Benedicte Pesle","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Getting Sam Home","tagline":"","description":"Three old chums agree to take the ailing Sam on one last trip to see his flousy girl-friend, Lily Bless Her, in the middle of the night.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/9/9/7/8/5/1099785-getting-sam-home-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=e54b2b7b1a"},{"name":"Vellai Roja","tagline":"","description":"Vellai Roja is a 1983 Indian Tamil film, directed by A.
