James Baldwin once returned a writing assignment about Naples, because he utterly failed to grasp the city. A Neapolitan says: \`Naples is a kaleidoscope of thousands of different souls. Their total defines the Soul of Naples.' The leitmotif is Caravaggio's painting Seven Works of Mercy (1607), made for an aristocratic charity that still exists.

His humour is harsh; he draws people in all their spinelessness, sadness and dishonesty, with a remarkable eye to facial expressions and postures.

Power and Impotence tells the utopia of political change: the adventure of common men accessing power to try and challenge the system from within. In a political thriller settled in stranger-than-fiction Paraguay, we follow their hopes and disappointments from a unique behind-the-scene point of view, until the tragic ending.

In conversation with documentarian Steven McIntyre, Dirk guides us through more than 40 years of his filmmaking: the early years exploring technique and technology, a subsequent phase of unflinching self-examination brought on by upheaval and overseas travel, and more recent projects where he attempts a fusion of personal, cultural, and historical identity. What emerges is an inspiring, rugged, and at times poignant portrait of an artist committed to self-expression and self-discovery through the medium of film.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/1/1/5/1/8/211518-the-house-that-eye-live-in-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=d75c4b1d06"},{"name":"Discipline and phylogeny","tagline":"","description":"The video is a montage of elements, still images and found footage, which, in the resulting combination, revolve around the theme discipline/form, as related to organisms in general and the human organism specifically.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/0/3/3/6/3/503363-discipline-and-phylogeny-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=aa8c0d5d85"},{"name":"El Nexo","tagline":"","description":"Signs from another planet arrive on Earth, exactly at Villa 21 de Barracas (Buenos Aires).
