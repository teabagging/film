Western industrial production is a site of magical thinking: an old history that will never return, an idealized construction that never really was. It's impossible to know what the true costs would be if it were to return - societal, environmental, and psychological C and yet, entire political campaigns are built around this.  This piece speculates on re-industrialization, and is a sequel to my 2013 video, Safety First (Bad, Dont Touch, Mercy!). Like its prequel, it posits a non-specific future populated by female factory workers. The geometric aesthetics of power and the romance of industrial-era alienation, are paired with theoretical and fictional texts about alternate social economies.  Video footage was shot in Ohio, animation and soundtrack by the artist. Voiceover text sources include Industrial supply catalogs, OSHA safety manuals, Monique Wittigs Les Guerilleres, and Adornos Minima Moralia.\\"  -Taken from Jen Liu's Vimeo page.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/2/5/3/3/0/625330-the-machinist-s-lament-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=23d93ed710"},{"name":"Youp van 't Hek: Wat is de vraag?","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/4/2/2/4/0/242240-youp-van-t-hek-wat-is-de-vraag--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=aa168799eb"},{"name":"One-way street residents","tagline":"","description":"This film reviews the lives of 6 former residents of Sitir Street (Ghavam Al-Satna) and their memories of living on this street.

The resulting imagery is a hyper-reality of landscapes transformed by means of the camera's mechanical mediation. The sound design was created from naturally recorded sound phenomena and musical performances. The Romantic musical elements are reminiscent of lyrical depictions of nature and environment. The deliberate mediation of the sound and image suggests that our relationship to the environment cannot be viewed outside of the realm of the political.
