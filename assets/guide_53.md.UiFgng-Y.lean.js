Fortunately Taps, a lawyer working for the underworld, will console them both.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/1/9/1/3/71913-the-people-s-enemy-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=793a92e536"},{"name":"N?ddebo Pr?stegaard","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/2/9/2/8/9/129289-noddebo-prstegaard-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=30e0a9ed54"},{"name":"Opened by Mistake","tagline":"","description":"Patsy tries to stay with Thelma at the hospital where she works, but Thelma is forced to pretend that Patsy is a patient.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/1/8/0/5/5/218055-opened-by-mistake-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=ec6d615706"},{"name":"Two White Snake Ghosts","tagline":"","description":"The white snake demon transforms into a beautiful woman when she is attracted to a man named Khouw Han Boen.

With so many citing his movies as influences, whether they're in the audience, or pursuing their own journey into film, his impact on cinema is unmatched. The influence of Spielberg stems from his ability to span genres and generations, from E.T. to Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan to Ready Player One, telling the stories of ordinary people dealing with extraordinary circumstances.
