Mic feedback is a useful paradigm for generating audiovisual works because it involves an inextricable relationship between the sonic qualities of the feedback and the positioning of the microphone - or, to put it another way, it links (visual) spatial information with audible results. By digitally simulating these microphones, their locations can be animated in any number of ways to provide a synchronized counterpart with the generated sounds, and the motion of these animations will correspond with the resulting sonic changes as microphones move closer and further from the virtual speakers. Small undulations become vibrato, twists and turns lead to Doppler effects, and sudden movements generate percussive attacks. Other parameter changes like distortion, autotuning, and video feedback, are programmed alongside these movements to help establish the arc of the piece.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/2/9/8/1/3/729813-three-paths-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=b2b0c56057"},{"name":"Venice: Flamboyant to the End","tagline":"","description":"No city in the world has sparked as many desires and fantasies as Venice.

Then, in 1797, Venice surrendered to Napoleon Bonaparte. Carnival was over, and the masks came off.

Here, a painstaking Scientist employs an assortment of gels, liquids, and weird contraptions to minister arcane beauty treatments to a sleeping Muse. The skin and hair play key roles for the female specimen fortunate enough to be on the receiving end of a new kind of super-sensory beauty treatment.  McRae describes her film inspired chiefly by nineteenth-century scientist and philosopher Hermann von Helmholtz, and his revolutionary research on human perception: Everything, wrote Helmholtz, is an event on the skin. I wanted to suggest a journey inside a world beyond skin care, one that involves farther realms of perception within the sensory landscape of the human body.'","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/9/3/5/6/5/993565-morphe-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=50431d2686"},{"name":"Scary True Stories: Night 23","tagline":"","description":"26th installment in Broadway's \\"Honto ni Atta Kowai Hanashi\\" series.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/0/2/1/5/2/1102152-scary-true-stories-night-23-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=fe252729f1"},{"name":"Love at Second Sight","tagline":"","description":"Sophie wants to marry Martin and change her traditional farm into a farm that produces biologically grown food (sheep cheese, ...)

One or two numbers fall short of greatness, but within the limits of what was available to them, the producers live up to the ambitious title. Domingo is particularly well represented with three arias, and Carreras has two. Only one Pavarotti performance is shown, but it's a good one: a youthful Celeste Aida from San Francisco. But the real meat is in the work of the other nine tenors. The muscular Samson of Jon Vickers contrasts with the bel canto delicacy of Mark Ainsley and Max-Rene Cosotti. Vladimir Atlantov as Otello, Giacomo Aragall as Cavaradossi, and Neil Shicoff as Rodolfo in La Bohme show that Domingo is not the sole proprietor of these roles.

Millions of years ago it was colonized by a little fish called 'Cichlid'. Otters, crocodiles, cobras and cormorants all hunt the fish in clear water. How the Cichlid survived and evolved is an incredible story for, millions of years later, there are over 200 new species - all found only in Lake Tanganyika. Incredibly, they have evolved to look like coral reef fish. There are cichlid equivalents of tuna, snapper, gobies and goatfish. They have evolved bizarre methods of breeding with mouth-incubation, lekking and, unique amongst fish, there is even a cuckoo. Despite all their specialization over millions of years, if an opportunity presents itself, the little fish can behave like their unspecialized ancestor. In the climax of the film, they bang together to feast on a hatch of sardine fry. This is the story of how one little fish has conquered a lake.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Noel Field: The Fictitious Spy","tagline":"","description":"In the 1930s and 40s, American Noel Field saved innumerable lives, and his volunteer work offered hope for refugees and immigrants.
