It updates the ethnographic film record begun in the 1950s by John Marshall, whose films documented 50 years of change, and who together with Claire Ritchie, established a grass-roots development foundation, which Adrian Strong (the filmmaker) joined in the late 1980s. Through archival footage and discussions with community members, this film sensitively examines the problems (lions, elephants, conservationists) currently facing the Ju/'hoansi and challenges the myth that they are culturally unable to farm. The film investigates the perpetuation of this myth by showing how tourists and filmmakers still demand to see how people used to live rather than they way they live now, and how the Ju/'hoansi cope with such expectations, while steadfastly continuing to farm against all the odds.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Burma Displaced","tagline":"","description":"Burmese citizens on the run, oppressed for decades by a brutal military dictatorship, still, to this day, fleeing into an uncertain future.

The National Weather Bureau learned about it from merchant ships at sea and predicted it would blow itself out at Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, as such storms usually did. Within 24 hours, the storm ripped into the New England shore with enough fury to set off seismographs in Sitka, Alaska. Traveling at a shocking 60 miles per hour -- three times faster than most tropical storms -- it was astonishingly swift and powerful, with peak wind gusts up to 186 mph. Over 600 people were killed, most by drowning. Another hundred were never found. Property damage was estimated at $400 million -- over 8,000 homes were destroyed, 6,000 boats wrecked or damaged.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/8/8/7/8/6/988786-american-experience-the-hurricane-of-1938-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=e6f1152e1b"},{"name":"Chinna Alludu","tagline":"","description":"When Girisham, a matrimonial agent, is insulted by a rich man for suggesting an alliance not worthy of his wealth,he comes up with a plan to avenge his humiliation.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"The Debutante","tagline":"","description":"The surreal story of Amber, a reluctant debutante, and her visits to the city zoo, where she hatches a plot to avoid her coming out ball.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Campus Culture Wars: Five Stories About Political Correctness","tagline":"","description":"What happens when \\"political correctness\\" comes in conflict with freedom of speech?

The Saint with Two Faces introduces some of the leading women followers of St John, both at work cleaning the beach for tourists, and at home with their children. A group of these women describe their beliefs about St John and the way in which they organise his Feast.
