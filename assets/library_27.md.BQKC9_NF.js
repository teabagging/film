He spent his life in pursuit of the ideal of beauty, an ideal that found expression in three of the most extraordinary, ornate architectural schemes imaginable - the castle of Neuschwanstein and the palaces of Linderhof and Herrenchiemsee. Today, these three buildings are among Germany's biggest tourist attractions.  Dan Cruickshank explores the rich aesthetic of Ludwig II - from the mock-medievalism of Neuschwanstein, the iconic fairytale castle that became the inspiration for the one in Walt Disney's Sleeping Beauty, to the rich Baroque splendour of Herrenchiemsee, Ludwig's answer to Versailles. Dan argues that Ludwig's castles are more than flamboyant kitsch and are, in fact, the key to unravelling the eternal enigma of Ludwig II.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/7/0/8/6/1/170861-the-fairytale-castles-of-king-ludwig-ii-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=4c3323bab8"},{"name":"The Rehearsals","tagline":"","description":"Igor and Alexandra are 30 -years old lovers.She is a theater production designer.He is an actor.She works hard,he drinks.They cannot leave and cannot get on.This story is about eternal problem of choice and talent to listen to ones heart .About a dangerous illusion of the youth that there is a lot of time to make mistakes and that is too early to make decision,to get married,to give birth to a child.The main characters have to realize that there is no time and there is no rough copy we have to live present moment because tomorrow may never come.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/5/5/3/7/7/455377-the-rehearsals-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=13dce62d72"},{"name":"Paranoia","tagline":"","description":"When her own past starts haunting, Alma runs back into where it all began.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/8/5/1/4/6/385146-paranoia-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=6b3d01794b"},{"name":"Climbing with Pride","tagline":"","description":"A documentary exploring the largest convention of queer rock climbers in the world and the reasons behind its forming.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/0/4/4/2/8/604428-climbing-with-pride-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=9ac7fc2096"},{"name":"SEESAW","tagline":"","description":"In a wheel-shaped town, where houses rotate on the inhabitants' whims, the comfort of some is the demise of others.

(Killer whales are actually part of the dolphin family, but they feel no compunction about feeding on their smaller cousins--not a scene for the squeamish!) But perhaps the most impressive part of this documentary are the scenes of a dolphin pod working in concert to trap a shimmering, mammoth school of sardines.

In this story adapted from Giovanni Boccaccio's Decameron, a young teenage couple is sent to live in a nearby town by the man's uncle, in an attempt to keep them safe from harm. She is from the lower classes, and he comes from a noble family -- a family that opposes his choice of a future bride. While en route to the town, the couple's horses are stolen and they are forced to continue through the forest on foot -- at a pace that introduces them to a kaleidoscope of Boccaccio's characters, from masters of mysticism, to soldiers of the warring Papal armies. Somehow, the couple manage to get through this gauntlet of sorts, and they do marry. Just as they are ready to go back to Rome, they hear that there is an insurrection in the offing, and suddenly, their brief spate of stability is threatened again.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/4/6/2/6/8/146268-bosco-d-amore-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=fdeab44cc0"},{"name":"Pick Up Your Feet, The Double Dutch Show","tagline":"","description":"Skip Blumberg's film Pick Up Your Feet, The Double Dutch Show.

Before there was a music business there was Henry Stone, The Record Man. From distributing records out of his '48 Packard to establishing TK Records as the largest independent label of the 1970s, Henry had an ear for hits. His funky eight-track studio and chart topping family of artists including KC and the Sunshine Band, led to the original Miami Sound and birth of Disco. When his empire collapsed on a baseball field in Chicago in 1979, Henry didnt miss a beat launching Miami Freestyle. Turning personal tragedy into an opportunity to empower others, through Henry Stone we witness the dramatic arc of the record business from inception through the digital age. With photographs unearthed after 40 years, THE RECORD MAN captures a forgotten musical history.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/1/1/1/1/7/311117-the-record-man-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=73b928de5d"},{"name":"Punto ciego","tagline":"","description":"Ulises is a young and innovative documentary filmmaker who films from his window.

Once on the jury, the young bureaucrat starts looking into the past himself and gets embroiled in a labyrinth. The past may well be unclear because recent leaders have certain facts that need to be kept buried. Filmmaker Janos Kovacsi borrows characteristics from revolutions in the Eastern European block (1950s-1980s) to create this post-revolutionary society with an idealist commander (Ferenc Zenthe) meant to lead them. A clue as to what happens next lies in the opening scene -- the funeral of the commander who has given his life for his cause. Ironically, Kovacsi undoubtedly faced censorship on this film. That would not only account for some uneven narration, but it adds a dimension of reality to the topic at hand.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/2/3/2/1/9/323219-the-right-man-for-a-delicate-mission-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=6bd4fbae55"},{"name":"The Family","tagline":"","description":"A young woman tries to finish her dissertation while family chaos rages around her.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/2/0/9/5/8/420958-the-family-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=5dcd3c20d7"},{"name":"Argie","tagline":"The curious adventure of an argentine who declared war to Britain on London 1982.","description":"The time is the summer of 1982, and the Falklands war is at hand when the young \\"Argie\\" follows a British woman home and is stopped from raping her only because she starts to speak to him in Spanish, soon they enter into an ambivalent relationship, undecided as to whether they love or hate each other, or both.

When repairing a car engine and deciding to disappear into the city, Layl experiences strange phenomena. He opens up to what is still unknown about the plurality of worlds and their inhabitants as the night closes in around him. The film probes the possibility of a hybrid body in a crisis zone, itself becoming a territory where purity is impossible.

The concentration of the faces on what is before them takes away their self-consciousness, and like a series of Thomas Ruff portraits they have an unsettling air of insouciance.
