The judge is free to assess the evidence. All that counts is the judicial conviction, which ideally also corresponds to the objective truth. But how often is this really the case? How easily do we believe our own prejudices when in doubt? How quickly can we be manipulated? And how do we know when someone is lying? Knowledge of these soft factors also makes it difficult for people at the head of a court to decide whether guilt or innocence. In the end, the judges also have to live with a verdict that has serious consequences for those involved.

The only thing he could do was send someone to Cuba whom he trusted, someone who could convince Castro. This person was Anastas Mikoyan. He was accompanied on his mission by Roman Carmen, a legendary cameraman who filmed the Spanish Civil War, World War II and the Nuremberg Trials. Mikoyan's business trip lasted almost a month. Day after day, step by step, like a real psychologist, he talked with Castro and Che Guevara, listened to their calls to \\"die beautifully\\" and destroy the enemy with one blow, and tried to persuade Cuba to compromise to save the world. This film was born thanks to recently declassified documents.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/7/7/3/2/3/777323-a-history-of-an-assignment-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=f6037c96f7"},{"name":"Rain Walk Through Sun and Moon","tagline":"","description":"A writer goes into crisis and can no longer produce.

And what does achieving the American Dream really feel like? Not everyone gets to answer that question for themselves, and some who do may take it for granted. In Cumberland, Maryland, disappearing industry over the last 30 years has left the city economically depressed and half-deserted. The citys new mayor has taken it upon himself to inspire a revitalization, and his plan starts with buying up homes in The Rolling Mill, a once vibrant neighborhood stricken by the same ills as the city. With every willing seller who leaves The Rolling Mill behind, the mayors plan to change Cumberlands fortunes by building a new chain restaurant progresses. But as the face of the neighborhood they love changes so drastically, a steadfast group of long-time Rolling Mill residents have refused to relent to the city.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Our Only Hope","tagline":"","description":"Old miner is trying to start a new life after the deathly accident in the mine.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/6/4/5/9/8/364598---0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=25d7cf66fd"},{"name":"Omar Al Azrak","tagline":"Omar Elazrak","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/2/9/6/6/6/429666---0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=0f8a21c9b9"},{"name":"Kairos","tagline":"","description":"Man's ascent to space.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/0/0/1/2/7/400127-kairos-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=93aac55060"},{"name":"The Last Hours","tagline":"","description":"A man deals with the emotions he feels in his wife's final hours.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/0/0/4/8/0/400480-the-last-hours-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=aa92021a6e"},{"name":"Poor People Relax Me","tagline":"Aesthetic abuse of the fewly privileged turned against the privileged few","description":"Clara wakes up in Mexico determined to turn the aesthetic abuse of the fewly privileged against the privileged few.

One of my neighbors came here to recover from bad health, too. However, my life nowadays became so sad and bitter. Transmission towers, called 765 something, are said to be built in the neighborhood, and it is making so much trouble. Last year, an old man who lived in another town not far from here, killed himself because of it. And I, trying to stop the construction people cutting down trees, was dragged around by young men far below my age, getting insulted with harsh words I'd never heard before. I still have the scars from being beaten by them back then. People say that 64 transmission towers are going to be seated in Miryang.

The sequence of frames plays out at 24 frames per second. In the same way that the persistence of vision creates the illusion of smooth linear movement in frame-by-frame animation, the mind is able to re-instate some of the lost visual/color information. Concurrently, the static composition of the photographic image dictates a pattern in time. A vertical line will appear at the same place in time repeatedly creating a beat while horizontal lines and forms become an undulation.
