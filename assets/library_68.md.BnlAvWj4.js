In the Second World War, too, the German submarines played a central role in the naval war until the Allied oversight and new detection systems hunted the hunters. Of the 40,000 U-boat men of the German war marines, 30,000 did not return home. The film tells the exciting story of the German U-boat arm from the early beginnings to the surrender in May 1945.

As Maureen Goslings celebratory portrait reveals, early solidarity with those suffering racial and economic injustice sparked Danes passion to use her talent to sustain marginalized people. Rather than chase stardom, she followed her own maternal instincts to root herself and her family among generations of activist performers. Bonnie Raitt, Jane Fonda and other notables attest to Danes unique way of shaping and being shaped by tumultuous social revolutions from the 1950s on.

Three days after his death, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of Jesus, and other women go up to the tomb to put spices on Christ's body. They are shocked to find the tomb completely empty. Jesus' body is gone. The now frightened women go running out of the tomb, when two angels stop them. They declare to the women that Christ has risen!
