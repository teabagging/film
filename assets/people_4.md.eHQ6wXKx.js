It prompted both France and Britain to declare war within 48 hours. The Nazis then conquered Norway, Denmark and France, and set its bombers' sights on Britain. In this lecture, Victor Davis Hanson explores the blitzkrieg tactics that fueled Adolf Hitler's success and the foolish appeasement philosophy that empowered Germany, Italy, Japan and, for a while, the Soviet Union. Hanson also gives viewers a peek into the lunacy that eventually led Hitler to invade the Soviet Union and the Japanese to attack Pearl Harbor.

All 1,200 Lott employees have developmental disabilities, yet the company competes with traditional non-disabled businesses and achieves the highest quality ratings. When the US auto industry crisis hits, however, Lott's market is wiped out and president Joan Browne has 12 months to reinvent or close the doors. For the workers, the stakes are even higher since their jobs are a refuge, not only from the impoverishment that affects the majority of America's disabled, but from social isolation. For employees Kevin, Wanda and T.J., work is more than just a direly needed paycheck, it's a lifeline, a symbol of their dignity, and their dreams made real. The race to find a new business plan drives this engrossing recession economy drama, but it's the humanity the film restores to the balance sheet that makes A Whole Lott More such a rare achievement.

Featured locations include Mammoth Mountain, CA, and an invitation-only spring racing derby; Mt Vernasus in Greece, which hosts a school for ski-ophytes; and some truly outrageous '70s freestyle action from Squaw Valley, Park City, Sun Valley, and Colorado's Breckenridge, Keystone, Copper and A-Basin resorts. Generous portions of Warren Miller's trademark humor and some crazy kaleidoscopic effects make \\"Ski a la Carte\\" the perfect sample of vintage 1970s Warren Miller.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/4/8/0/5/74805-ski-ala-carte-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=8522058e1b"},{"name":"El Juancito","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/7/3/1/3/4/773134-el-juancito-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=2b7a71b482"},{"name":"Ne pleure pas","tagline":"","description":"Marc Lafarge, 13, is idolized by his brother Thomas, 20, future veterinarian and amateur boxer.

Electropop queen Zara Larsson performs songs from her fourth studio album 'Venus', alongside fan-favourites 'Lush Life', 'I Would Like', 'Never Forget You' and 'Symphony', on her first European tour since 2019. Captured on 26 February 2024 at AFAS Live, the show features luscious pastel and magenta stage lighting, ethereal orbital-like visuals, a powerful female collective of musicians and dancers, plus all the frills and sparkle. Shooting to multi-platinum stardom over the past decade, Zara continues her reign of 'mothering' - sorry - owning the stage as if it were her last concert, radiating confidence, charm, and (unsurprisingly) some pretty killer dance moves in front of thousands of fans.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/5/0/3/5/8/1150358-zara-larsson-venus-tour-live-concert-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=e745245a40"},{"name":"Esperanza H.","tagline":"An epistolary love","description":"After committing a petty crime, a young man unexpectedly receives a confession of love.

The viewer can decide whether or not the film is beautiful or whether it is a glossy excuse for pedophilia. It is set just after World War II. A man has discovered and read Celine's diary which is filled with sexual longing and sensuality. The child herself, only portrayed as a photograph, describes her relations with a recently widowed hairdresser. The film contains little formal dialog and mostly focuses upon the daily lives of the people involved. The setting of the seduction is shown, but not the seduction itself.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/9/9/3/3/9/499339-venial-sin-mortal-sin--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=0ac1d4b94b"},{"name":"Las delicias del matrimonio","tagline":"","description":"Housewife-angst is making the Missus crazy, so when her husband loses his job, they switch roles.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/1/4/1/3/8/314138-las-delicias-del-matrimonio-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=8215ae070f"},{"name":"Farewell to Agnes","tagline":"","description":"A psychodrama based on the criminal activities of the former STASI (state security police) in the now defunct German Democratic Republic.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/2/0/1/3/0/320130-farewell-to-agnes-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=98b356eb97"},{"name":"Bottom","tagline":"","description":"A dramatic, suggestive glimpse at expected roles and sexual sterotyping of the gay Asian male, which makes an offer of escape through rejection of white male desire.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"The Boy Who Fell in Love","tagline":"","description":"A tale of an HIV positive young man, his lover who died from AIDS and axolotls- the larval stage of a species of salamander which give birth and die while still physically immature.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Modern Marvels: Las Vegas","tagline":"","description":"Known as America's \\"neon oasis,\\" Las Vegas has become synonymous with fantasy, folly and excess.

Bernstein drew analogies to other disciplines, such as poetry, aesthetics, and especially linguistics, hoping to make these lectures accessible to an audience with limited or no musical experience, while maintaining an intelligent level of discourse: This lecture takes its name from a line in John Keats' poem, \\"On the Grasshopper and Cricket\\". Bernstein does not discuss Keats' poem directly in this chapter, but he provides his own definition of the poetry of earth, which is tonality. Tonality is the poetry of earth because of the phonological universals discussed in lecture 1. This lecture discusses predominantly Stravinsky, whom Bernstein considers the poet of earth.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/1/7/9/6/9/1017969-the-unanswered-question-vi-the-poetry-of-earth-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=28413fbaf6"},{"name":"Jak ulovit tygra","tagline":"","description":"A short animated film.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Moondance I","tagline":"","description":"One of Varela's luminous abstractions of the moon.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/3/9/8/0/6/839806-moondance-i-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=8252fb8909"},{"name":"O utrzenm sluchtku","tagline":"","description":"The first episode of the \\"Mach and Sebestova\\" series.
