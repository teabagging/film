No sound. I shot it on 8mm film in 1972 and finished it in 1976 as a 16mm film. The surface of motion picture film is organic matter, made from skin and hooves of cattle. Motion picture film, especially color film, has an emulsion of slightly varying thickness, so that the images on each physical frame can be seen in slight relief when looked at under reflected light. This surface structure is exploited in \\"Skins\\", through a slow process of soaking in water until dye layers (first yellow, then magenta, and last cyan) that constitute the images, lift off the film substrate and rearrange themselves in curtains of wrinkled matter. The effect is to reanimate the original subject matter of the film recording, taxidermy animals in a natural history museum diorama. Another effect is to unleash the organic matter of emulsion first animated by a living creature.

The camerawork focuses on the impressive ruins of these earlier invaders. Although the film also depicts the enduring architecture of Muslim rulers, such as Akbar and Shahjahan, it is stressed that their power has been superseded.

German actress Gitta Alpar stars as Jeanne, the young 18th century Parisian milliner who sleeps her way to the uppermost rungs of French aristocracy, emerging at last as the glamorous Madame du Barry, mistress of Louis XV (Owen Nares). Refusing to gloss over du Barry's sexual peccadilloes (as previous films with Norma Talmadge and Dolores del Rio had done), the film presents the \\"heroine\\" as a whore, pure and simple-or, on second thought, not so pure and simple! Particularly troublesome for American censors was a scene in which du Barry is depicted as a resident of a bawdy house. Otherwise, The Loves of Madame du Barry is standard historical-drama fare, allowing dozens of top European actors to play \\"dress-up\\" for 90 minutes.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/6/1/8/3/7/361837-i-give-my-heart-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=850e6ab45c"},{"name":"Ginger","tagline":"Now you'll love the \\"meanie\\" of \\"Bright Eyes\\"!","description":"Ginger, an orphan, is living with her foster-uncle, Rexford Whittington, a broken-down Shakesperian actor.

The mechanism is unusual: a director makes a short and sends it to the next director, who in turn makes his own short for the purpose of plagiarizing the one he received. And so the chain of plagiarism continues until it reaches the last one. Each one interprets in their own way what it means to plagiarize the received film. The first link in the chain is James Benning, one of the world's most patient filmmakers. His extensive plans are replicated in the following fragments. Disobedience moves the exercise away from literality and an exploration of the texture of the images begins. In its repetitive mechanism, we can see that cinema is, in addition to record of  reality, an art of images and sound.
