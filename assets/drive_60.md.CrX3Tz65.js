Although the port has lost its importance, the rich past is still present in the impoverished city. The film echoes this ambiguous situation in its dialectical poetic style, interweaving the daily life reality (of 1963) with the history of the city and changing from black and white to colour, finally leaving us with hopeful perspective for the children who are playing on the stairs and hills of this beautiful town.","rating":"3.85","theme":"Heists and thrilling action","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/5/8/7/5/65875-valparaiso-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=6b0219ee39"},{"name":"Conviction","tagline":"An extraordinary journey of how far we go to fight for our family.","description":"When Betty Anne Waters' older brother Kenny is arrested for murder and sentenced to life in 1983, Betty Anne, a Massachusetts wife and mother of two, dedicates her life to overturning the murder conviction.
