The film is titled after a fairy tale that Ghassan had written for his niece Lamis, which is a metaphorical narration of the development of a bottom-up democracy that can break down the barriers of refugee camps and overcome indifference through engagement and culture. The narrative frame of the film consists of a laboratory, conceived and coordinated by the director, in the kindergarten created by Anni in the Burj elBarajneh refugee camp. It ends with the staging of the theatrical adaptation of Ghassans fairy tale in two theatres in Beirut.

The scenes that were made in a pseudo-documentary manner of the rebellious 1970s remind of medieval Pieta exalting self-sacrificingness, pain, suffering and religious ecstasy. Richard Hell Meyers, one of the representatives of the rock culture of the 70s, came up with a term of blank generation (the term may evidently be interpreted as a lost generation) to describe himself and his friends and thus advanced a philosophy of people seeking self-destruction. They get involved in meaningless and deadly situations to find a justification for living their lives. The film represents a story about wounded young men, who find themselves on an island and meet there a girl sailing the seas in a military launch, as a metaphor for an attempt to save the blank/lost generation.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/9/0/7/9/6/690796-lullaby-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=b4b3d9aef3"},{"name":"The Lunar Month","tagline":"","description":"An exploration of trans lesbian caring and love.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Lust","tagline":"","description":"Lust revolves around Spencer, a delivery boy, whose innocent crush on one of his costumers devolves into an unnatural, sexual obsession that ends in tragedy.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Lyfe","tagline":"","description":"A man discovers deleting his VR account may not so easy.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Macau Stories 3 - City Maze","tagline":"","description":"Macau Stories 3 - City Maze is composed of three individual stories.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/2/2/2/8/5/722285-macau-stories-3-city-maze-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=e011b666c5"},{"name":"Mafkoud","tagline":"","description":"Years after his abduction, missing Sari still remembers small details from the moment he last saw his mother, specifically, her eyes and her words asking him to never look back.

As the film begins, it evokes an almost documentary sensibility, in part through its use of voice-over narration (in English). Though the film might at first seem to be a relatively traditional work, it is not long until this impression changes, and drastically. The character design and voice recording, along with fantastically unrestricted cinematography and editing, combine with folk songs (sung in Estonian, with English subtitles) that might be described as 'quirky' or maybe just 'really odd.' Some dialogue is presented in 'word bubbles' printed on the film as well. So much is going on, on so many levels, that the film defies its viewer to look away -- and who would want to? It's all wonderful. The Mosquito and the Horse clearly demonstrates how successful a film can be operating outside the classical Hollywood model.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Motel Paraiso","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/7/5/3/8/0/1175380-motel-paraiso-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=392e35d970"},{"name":"Mother Bunker","tagline":"","description":"Sometime in the future, humans and robots are embroiled in war.
