The husband-and-wife tandem of Oneyda Gonzlez and Gustavo Prez (They Would All Be Queens) hail from the Cuban province of Camagey, where Sarduy was born. Traveling from Havana to Miami and Paris, they set out to unravel the mystery that was one of the islands most transgressive artists, gaining unprecedented access to the Sarduy archives from his longtime companion Fran?ois Wahl.

Throughout the years, mostly poor unskilled workers flocked to the neighborhood to work in all aspects of the funerary procession. As traditions changed and evolved, these professions gained structure and gravitas but never escaped their discomforting associations. In 'Death under control' we meet the descendants of the first workers of death.  Businesses that go back for at least 4 generations with undisrupted continuity.

Richard Wagner himself understood the innovative character of his sixth piece of music theatre, completed in 1848, the year of revolutions. Although it is reckoned among his romantic operas, his new vision of musical drama is already clearly heralded in this work. In his hands, the mediaeval saga of the Knight of the Swan becomes a meditation on the true love that asks no questions. Alain Altinoglu, our Music Director, who has already conducted this work in Bayreuth, guarantees the quality of the music, while the director Olivier Py, known at La Monnaie for his brilliant productions of Les Huguenots and Hamlet, can be relied on not to downplay Wagners revolutionary political side. Wagners own opinion was that one can only understand Lohengrin if one can liberate oneself from any modern-looking, generalising form of representation so as to see the phenomena of real life. A challenge to us all?","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/3/6/1/3/8/636138-lohengrin-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=fd2e73c1e4"},{"name":"Banik!!!","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/0/6/9/3/4/706934-banik--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=0496d63bb7"},{"name":"Celina's Son","tagline":"","description":"Celina's Son is an intimate portrait of one of Puerto Rico's most celebrated singers of all time.
