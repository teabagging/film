The work, dating from 1988, was the first to give a voice to disadvantaged individuals whose very existence had been a taboo. In addition to unpicking the tragic personal stories of drug users just surviving on the fringes of late Kdr-era society, another important purpose of the film was that it investigated the official side of the problem as well. It is evident from what those interviewed had to say that meaningful steps were put off for decades by the fact that the whole issue of drugs was a forbidden subject in Hungary.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/1/1/8/7/8/1011878-floating-free-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=ca6119c33a"},{"name":"Kdy? v rji pr?elo","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/8/1/1/0/2/881102-kdyz-v-raji-prselo-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=d29d02ef66"},{"name":"Clip Clap Jazz","tagline":"","description":"Experimental short by Teo Hernndez.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/0/0/3/7/7/1000377-clip-clap-jazz-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=fb5ddf1ec4"},{"name":"Killer's Love","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/5/3/1/4/4/853144--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=f3288d2662"},{"name":"Egy gazdag h?lgy szeszlye","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/2/2/3/7/6/722376-egy-gazdag-holgy-szeszelye-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=829c288ed7"},{"name":"The Odyssey Tapes","tagline":"","description":"A study of concert-artist Richard Dyer-Bennet at work on Homer's Odyssey - that is, developing a strategy for performing, in English, and in 1978, with harp in hand, this monumental 24 hour poem, which, in Homer's time and Homer's life, only existed in oral form - a long song, performed in public as entertainment and as tribal history.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/1/8/1/3/3/618133-the-odyssey-tapes-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=a62ec461b3"},{"name":"Ate?

The island has been negligently placed under far too large a kolkhoz. Enormous alcoholism is prevalent among the male population and, increasingly, among the women. Sheer possession of money has become a standard of regard. If a family cannot spare 4,000 roubles for the marriage of their children, they are ignored by the other islanders. In this dramatic as well as poetic documentary we see how the social awareness of a society has gone by the board.

And that strength was reflected in the emergence of several major 'Black Power' organisations. Since the 1960s the vital sense of black community which developed in the Grove has resisted attempts to disperse and weaken the community and in particular the attempt to suppress the annual Carnival - the major Afro-Caribbean event in Britain.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Patativa do Assar - Um Poeta do Povo","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/2/8/6/2/7/828627-patativa-do-assare-um-poeta-do-povo-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=3cde7b02a6"},{"name":"Windows","tagline":"","description":"Contrasting environments, in and outside.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/5/5/6/4/4/955644-windows-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=45a057ec1f"},{"name":"Die goldenen Schuhe","tagline":"","description":"German miniseries based upon the novel by Vicky Baum.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"A Shot In The Forest","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/6/8/1/4/3/168143-saviens-meza-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=630fe134be"},{"name":"Mathilde M?hring","tagline":"","description":"Adaptation of Theodor Fontane's novel.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/9/6/4/1/9/496419-mathilde-mohring-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=aaf093bbec"},{"name":"A Making Of FANTASTIC JOURNEY","tagline":"","description":"Making-of the film realized by the students of the Osaka Municipal High School Film Study Group.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/3/3/0/1/4/1033014-a-making-of-fantastic-journey-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=8265aee62a"},{"name":"Willie Nelson Live at the US Festival","tagline":"","description":"Willie Nelson appeared at the US Festival on June 4, 1983.

The film begins by following a single man from start to finish as he shapes a red clay pot. He extracts the clay from a mountainside, combines it with water and mica (a binding agent), and slowly forms the vessel with his hands. Downs documented this process intimately, using extreme close-ups to meditate on the artists hands as he works. As the film progresses, various establishing and mid-range shots are interspersed before transitioning to footage of other men creating their own pottery with their own techniques.

The undaunted Tsui sees the virtues in Pearl and teases her to teach lessons on marital harmony. With multiple schemes, Tsui teases, coaxes and has Pearl taste her own medicine. The battle of wits and the sexes becomes a joy to watch with Ma's complacent and roguish portrayal as a refined witty scholar clashing with the energetic and bickering Hung.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/8/6/5/1/8/686518-the-spoiled-princess-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=4415a24301"},{"name":"Ang Selosa","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/8/5/7/0/1/885701-ang-selosa-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=19c2e2a369"},{"name":"Eight-Ball Andy","tagline":"","description":"Andy's gadget-happy brother-in-law is driving him crazy.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/1/6/4/0/0/416400-eight-ball-andy-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=a5d960bc2a"},{"name":"El cantor del pueblo","tagline":"","description":"A worker looking for money for his blind mother's operation, presents himself as a tango singer and achieves success.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/9/7/7/3/5/997735-el-cantor-del-pueblo-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=ff720b8e55"},{"name":"Song of the Drifter","tagline":"TWO-GUN RHYTHM WRANGLERS!","description":"Jimmy joins Cannonball on a visit to the widow Fennamore, Cannonball's old girlfriend, at Firehole.
