Author of the book Rules for Radicals, Alinsky is widely considered the father of community organizing who spent his life advocating for improved living conditions in poor communities across the United States. In this impassioned debate, the young activists question the corrupting influence of power, and ask why Indigenous people cannot live traditionally and peacefully on the land. Alinsky responds, You have got to be part of the world in order to change it. You are not going to make any changes by staying in your corner. In Alinskys view, equality only happens when the disenfranchised have the strength to show the ruling powers that it will be more costly for them to withhold it. Encounter with Saul Alinksy offers fascinating insights into a conversation about power and activism that has lasting resonance today.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/4/6/3/2/6/646326-encounter-with-saul-alinsky-part-2-rama-indian-reserve-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=27ed770b97"},{"name":"Liebe fr Liebe","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Also gut!

Arnie spoke of his days of glory- performances with the greatest of his generation, from Dizzy Gillespie to Sonny Rollins, performances on prime-time television with Stan Getz and other icons and opening the New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music in New York.  Only after his death and curious about the truth behind Arnies stories, the director uncovers the story of this outstanding musician. This film follows the last days of iconic American jazz musician Arnie Lawrence, who fell from fame to homelessness in Israel where he created a bridge between people through music. His legacy is the generation of world-famous Israeli jazz musicians he inspired and who appear in the film.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/0/0/6/9/7/1100697-i-hear-a-rainbow-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=dc297f1b5b"},{"name":"Ikea Film","tagline":"","description":"A man's thoughts are projected as he gets lost in Ikea.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/6/7/7/6/9/567769-ikea-film-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=f21c5f1739"},{"name":"Il bruco e la gallina","tagline":"","description":"Short film by Michela Donini.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Il clan dei ricciai","tagline":"","description":"The documentary follows the stories of some ex-prisoners who try to reintegrate themselves into society by working as sea urchin divers.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/5/2/6/5/0/952650-il-clan-dei-ricciai-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=381940b477"},{"name":"Il club dei centenari","tagline":"","description":"The story and the scientific reasons behind the biggest community of centenaries in the world.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/5/2/6/5/1/952651-il-club-dei-centenari-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=f5b9f777c8"},{"name":"Ile Maurice, la douceur de l'ocan Indien","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/5/2/4/4/6/752446-ile-maurice-la-douceur-de-l-ocean-indien-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=b7d33cc262"},{"name":"Il Racconto Del Reale - L'Ultimo Stadio","tagline":"","description":"The first vertical webseries in 5 episodes on the clashes of 3 May 2014 around the Olympic stadium in Rome, on the occasion of the final of the Coppa Italia Napoli-Fiorentina.
