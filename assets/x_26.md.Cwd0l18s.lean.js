When a person is plagued with jealousy, they are willing to do almost anything in order to acquire what they desire.  Our protagonist, August, internalizes the relationship that his best friend Wren shares with his girlfriend Julia as a direct, personal attack on him and his identity. Due to the fact August is not getting the same amount of attention and affection that he is used to from Wren, he goes behind Wren's back to manipulate Julia.  August's internalized turmoil triggers an out-of-body experience that then drives him to make intimidating, coerced advances toward the people he loves.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/5/4/2/0/6/854206-ecstasy-behind-the-forgotten-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=abc822efd2"},{"name":"Sack Of Confessions","tagline":"","description":"Clyde, a young man who was ill and having difficulty talking, was a suspect for a vile crime, had gone to church to confess his sins, and an unexpected turn of events would happen as he brought something in the church holy room for confessions.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/5/4/3/9/5/954395-sack-of-confessions-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=5107920c85"},{"name":"Reine, la Reine","tagline":"I miss my cat.","description":"Reluctant stand-up comedian, Reine, prepares for her next show.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/5/3/8/5/5/953855-reine-la-reine-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=0432493754"},{"name":"Dreams Live in Trees","tagline":"","description":"Inspired by true events which took place in 1978 when Italy became the first country in the world to abolish mental asylums.
