With a fierce precision Coe uncovers the base violence inherent in a range of political and social issues C from apartheid and the arms industry, to rape and gentrification. Yet, as the film reveals in a spirited exchange between the artist and young people, Coes work is accessible to everyone.  The film features one of Coes most memorable works; Woman Walks into Bar  Is Raped by Four Men on the Pool Table  While 20 Watch.

It thus rejects that was at the time a dominant style in artist's video, turning on its head the simpler versions of the slogan that 'the personal is political'. At the same time it is a political work in a different sense, questioning the popular TV format of the in-depth personal interview which it ironizes. As such, and with Partridge himself playing the part of interviewer/director, it is his most overt 'intervention' into documentary drama even as he subverts it.\\" - Al Rees","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/1/2/6/2/2/712622-dialogue-for-two-players-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=202f1a7ffc"},{"name":"Theerppu En Kaiyil","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Die ewigen Gefhle","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Discs","tagline":"","description":"An experimental film showing various record covers.

In a starkly staged set-piece, the increasingly anguished figure of the artist and an actor playing the part of a former lover rake over the coals of their unmistakably terminal but palpably smouldering relationship, reliving past events and re-opening old wounds. The rising tensions and frustrated passions of the duos interaction are contrasted with the mechanical glide of the tracking camera that passes serenely and inexorably between them C its disinterested motion occasionally coinciding with an especially poignant moment, but frequently leaving any lingering personal sentiment trailing blankly in its wake.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Id?c, spotykaj?c...","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"I Do","tagline":"","description":"Demetrio has met Alfredo at Alfredo's bachelor party.
