In this film, Janis Lipzin blends her enduring interest in nature's volatile events with her sympathy with film's unpredictable response to light. She made a conscious decision to begin with film based on that medium's unduplicable and capricious reaction to photo-chemical stimuli. She used darkroom processes to produce outcomes that allude to (but don't truly describe) color in the natural world. Lipzin then interweaved the results with the more controllable properties of digital technology. By using both digital and analog tools, she was able to achieve results unattainable by either medium alone. The filmmaker's methods allow her to avoid many conventional industrial processes and vastly expand the boundaries of common color palettes.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/5/8/9/1/0/358910-de-luce-1-vegetare-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=a79f9cee1c"},{"name":"Kill Kill Faster Faster","tagline":"","description":"Recently paroled after serving a long stretch for his wife's murder, Joey One-Way aligns himself with a producer who has optioned the play he wrote in prison.

Director Basilio Martin Patino presents his story, and a large part of the film is based on his own life, through the experiences of an exiled heroine played by Charo Lopez. She has returned to Spain to look for meaning in her life, something that she never found living in Germany, not even after having a child. She is also in the process of translating the German lyric poet Friederich Holderlin (see the 1985 Halfte Des Lebens) into Spanish, focusing on his epic Hyperion. Excerpts from the translation are voiced over throughout the film. As she looks up old friends from many, many years ago, even those who have achieved worldly success are suffering from the same ennui that propelled her back home.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/7/4/6/2/8/174628-the-lost-paradise-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=6fdc37b297"},{"name":"Killing in the Nude","tagline":"","description":"Killing in the Nude is one of the rare hidden gems that are unknown to most in the history of Hong Kong soft core erotica.

Exploring video as both a mirror and a masking device, and using her body as an art object, she undertakes an examination of self and identity, subjectivity and objectivity. Creating a series of inversions, she splits her image, splits the video screen, and splits her identification within the video space, playing with the spatial ambiguity of non-reversed images (video) and reversed images (mirrors).

While Hummingbird creates a picture of its titular animal, the hummingbirds ultimate, abstract annihilation also points to the compatibility between abstraction and figuration allowed by computer animation. To make the film, over 30,000 individual images generated by a computer were drawn directly on film using a microfilm plotter. Each frame was programmed using one punch card, an example of the complex and labor-intensive operations required by early computer animation.

There he escapes to the world of memories, having imaginary conversations with his dead friend. However, the news of a new murder alerts him to the dangers lying ahead. Shot in Turkey following the years of military regime, Av Zamani carries autobiographical elements as the director Erden Kiral also had to flee the repressive regime of his country to be an exile in Germany. The weakness of the film is that the director is not able to take enough distance from the events to give the story a more universal appeal. Av Zamani was screened at the Montreal World Film Festival 1988.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/8/6/7/8/1/186781-hunting-time-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=606af6cb57"},{"name":"Mayflower Madam","tagline":"Sex Sells!
