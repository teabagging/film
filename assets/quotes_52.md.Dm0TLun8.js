Rick harvested an elk on the ancestral land of the Sinixt people in Vallican, British Columbia, Canada. To the Sinixt, hunting on ancestral land is an aboriginal right gifted to them by Creator. Its a right that has legally been denied to the Sinixt people since 1956 when the Canadian government unjustly declared them extinct in Canada, despite the nearly 3,000 members existing on the Colville Indian Reservation in Washington State. Now with the Desautel Hunting Case, the Sinixt people have a chance to not only bring light to their unjust extinction by the Canadian government but also to abolish the declaration completely.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Omar et Fred - SAV des missions, saison 6","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/2/1/0/9/5/1121095-omar-et-fred-sav-des-emissions-saison-6-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=3a5f74f95e"},{"name":"O Metro Quadrado","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"One Day at A Time","tagline":"One Day At A Time covers the pain, chaos, and joy that go hand in hand with addictions, thinking patterns, and recovery.","description":"A twenty-seven year old male is struggling with his demons and addictions.

Through Baya, I came to understand the resilience and strength of the human spirit, which remains unaltered by any amount of suffering  a testament to the noble dignity of human nature.\\"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/7/2/8/5/0/1072850-baya-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=f0585f1705"},{"name":"Crawling","tagline":"","description":"a black and white Performance video-art","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/7/0/5/9/0/1070590-crawling-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=acccc7497c"},{"name":"La Chagra: Un Camino de Vida","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/6/8/4/7/6/1068476-la-chagra-un-camino-de-vida-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=6de0c210b6"},{"name":"Barrette : L'humour de ma vie","tagline":"","description":"With 40 years of experience behind his neck, Michel Barrette presents his final career tour: L'HUMOUR DE MA VIE!

Chicago-native Angel Bat Dawid is one of the many talents tracked down by the US label International Anthem. Together with trumpeter Jaimie Branch and drummer Makaya McCraven, Angel Bat Dawid ensures that the \\"Windy City\\" is on the radar for jazz all over the world.  The musician switches between vocals, clarinet and piano with amazing ease. But apart from that, Angel Bat Dawid is able to breathe a highly spiritual dimension into her music like no other, so that her jazz almost borders on gospel. Listening to the multi-instrumentalist therefore sometimes has something of a transcendental experience, at times reminiscent of the music of Sun Ra.  This concert at Ground Control reveals all the artistic glory of their music. Recording of July 4, 2022 at Ground Control, Paris.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/8/2/6/3/6/982636-angel-bat-dawid-ground-control-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=bdd7d773e8"},{"name":"What's the Name of the Film?","tagline":"","description":"Women directors from the generation of 1968 made their first films in 1990s Turkey,  but what kind of working environment did they face?

As one of the twentieth centurys most influential maestros, Mahler redefined the conductors role. For him, the conductor is just as integral to his own musical works as they are to the composer. When a maestro steps onto the podium and opens the score, he recreates musical universes from scratch.
