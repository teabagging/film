Through extensive research and interviews with the nations top divorce lawyers, mediators, judges, politicians, litigants and journalists, DIVORCE CORP. uncovers how children are torn from their homes, unlicensed custody evaluators extort money, and abusive judges play god with peoples lives while enriching their friends. This explosive documentary reveals the family courts as unregulated, extra-constitutional fiefdoms. Rather than assist victims of domestic crimes, these courts often precipitate them. And rather than help parents and children move on, as they are mandated to do, these courts - and their associates - drag out cases for years, sometimes decades, ultimately resulting in a rash of social ills, including home foreclosure, bankruptcy, suicide and violence.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/6/8/9/9/3/168993-divorce-corp--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=7a1674920a"},{"name":"Ptio","tagline":"","description":"In the prison yard, the prisoners play football, dance capoeira and talk about freedom.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/4/3/0/5/5/143055-patio-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=1f2928a532"},{"name":"Newscaster/Dragon/Maggots","tagline":"","description":"The surreal film Newscaster/Dragon/Maggots is a transmission of what lurks in between the channels.

Two seemingly contrasting spaces merge to construct a new space. The first space is the living room of a retired couple. The second space is embodied in Super 8 recordings filmed by the old man during his numerous trips to Africa and Asia during the 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s. The pictures show exotic animals which are projected directly onto the walls and furniture of the house. The assembly of these differing spaces does not create a more succinct boundary between them, but rather assists in the mingling of the two spaces. In this fleeting moment of third space, as it is limited by time, a new cinematic reality is formed.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/5/3/9/3/0/353930-the-wild-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=34c4a6d1e2"},{"name":"Strawberry Summer","tagline":"","description":"High school music teacher Beth Landon puts herself on the line when she invites world-famous country singer Jason Keith to perform at her rural town's Strawberry Festival.
