There are those who see it as unnecessary to mention your pronouns when you introduce yourself, but the majority are in favor. Director Ingrid Kamerling switches smoothly between observation and interviews. Above all, there is a sense of the need to equip young people and their parents as well as possible for the emotional journey of drastic change that lies ahead of them.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/8/0/3/8/0/1080380-they-and-them-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=78b611a854"},{"name":"Isleen Pines","tagline":"","description":"A group of friends get together for the annual Halloween party, but are interrupted by mysterious visitors.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/2/7/2/3/1/927231-isleen-pines-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=f16e7feea9"},{"name":"How the Holocaust Began","tagline":"","description":"Historian James Bulgin reveals the origins of the Holocaust in the German invasion of the Soviet Union, exploring the mass murder, collaboration and experimentation that led to the Final Solution.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/7/2/2/6/4/972264-how-the-holocaust-began-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=1d992bc734"},{"name":"When The Pleasure Stops","tagline":"","description":"Nine straight months of comedy shows across the U.S. and Canada have left Stav burned out and fat as hell.

Once an adult, Arsi finds a way to escape the rigors of a U.S. tour and drowns his overworked self in drink, or seeks out one-night stands, or otherwise lets off steam. The tightly-wound spring that has been coiled since he was forced into his grueling training and work sessions -- shown through symbolic images -- eventually snaps in a healthy way, freeing Arsi at last to continue on, simply for the love of music.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/2/3/2/1/7/323217-da-capo-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=dc39748015"},{"name":"Passage secret","tagline":"","description":"In a somewhat deflated story of robbery and deception set against the rooftops and byways of Paris, a group of enterprising petty thieves take advantage of the dog days of August to burglarize vacated apartments.
