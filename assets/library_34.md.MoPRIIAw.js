Crystallizing the spirit of the conquests that took place in the Atacama Desert, a Peruvian prince once said in regard to the Indians: We must spare our enemies or we will hurt ourselves, because they will soon be ours with all that is theirs.

His hugely impressive body of work has in recent years also proved rich territory for an array of hip-hop heavyweights with Dr Dre and Eminem, Jay Z and Kanye West all discovering and sampling his music, bringing it to an entirely new generation of listeners around the world.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Rainbow Prince","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/8/2/7/9/8/882798-rainbow-prince-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=48a82ae3c2"},{"name":"El autor","tagline":"","description":"A woman asks a priest for help because her boyfriend is behaving strangely.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Christmas Movie","tagline":"","description":"Rooming together in a garage, two friends' Christmas eve night escalates into a realm of psychedelic hedonism.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/6/9/2/3/1/969231-christmas-movie-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=8c6b72c105"},{"name":"How Small!","tagline":"","description":"A young woman reminisces about her deceased grandmother, whose volatile personality troubled and confused her as a child.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/6/0/3/1/6/860316-how-small--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=3e92f64984"},{"name":"Autumn Leaves","tagline":"","description":"An exercise in synchronizing animation and music, based on a piece by the same name by Joe Pass.

Decades later, upon discovering the dwindling hamlet of Kandahar, Saskatchewan, he felt an immediate connection that needed to be explored. Abdul Bari Jamal's impulsive purchase of eight empty lots in the middle of the Canadian Prairies became an unexpected inheritance for his grown children. When the extended family of self-declared urbanites make their first trip together to witness their new property, Jamal's daughter takes the opportunity to document the unusual family vacation, hoping to unpack her father's relationship to his homeland and Canadian patriotism. What transpires on their journey is so much more than a humorous Green Acres collision of cultures-it's a heartfelt and moving conversation about two nations connected by conflict and how much of our identity is tied to the land we occupy.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/2/7/8/1/2/527812-a-kandahar-away-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=9b570654b0"},{"name":"Butera","tagline":"","description":"Butera is a young, timid princess who gains the courage to stand up for the people she loves after running away from home.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/2/6/8/0/1/526801-butera-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=b0e56ce1e7"},{"name":"The Outlander","tagline":"","description":"The story of Suleyman, an elephant gifted to the Portuguese king in 1542 who travelled across Europe","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/2/9/5/0/9/629509-the-outlander-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=55961e72f6"},{"name":"Wycieczka","tagline":"","description":"When approached by a rich Warsaw couple to help find the ruins of a church, a villager slowly steals the identity of the woman from the capital.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/8/8/9/3/0/788930-wycieczka-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=3d881a00db"},{"name":"Follow Your Dream","tagline":"","description":"The main character is a cute ambitious girl Rita from a provincial town on the Black Sea coast.
