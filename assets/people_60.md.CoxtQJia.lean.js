The time was 2:27 pm, I was standing by the Michigan Lake. In my hand there was a waterproof camera that weighs 2.6 ounces. I pressed the record button on the camera and threw it into the lake. The camera sank into the lake immediately and embarked on a mysterious journey. During the journey, it was elevated, pressed, panned, rotated, and spun by the water. The camera explored the space like a disembodied consciousness, and the moving image it captured was turned into an abstract painting improvised by Mother Nature. Eleven minutes later, the wave delivered the camera back onto the beach with one single long take. This eleven minutes long take later became Liquid Image.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/0/7/9/8/1/907981-liquid-image-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=d29dbd586c"},{"name":"Mission To Mars","tagline":"","description":"After the long journey everything seems to be going to plan but what happens when the banana navigation system deactivates.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/5/9/3/4/1/459341-mission-to-mars-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=97fb5277e5"},{"name":"Personae (Drei Generationen)","tagline":"","description":"The short film Personae is based on isolation, duplication, and repetition, deriving its wit and complexity from simple movements.

When the exterior framework collapses, when certain coordi- nates break, the temptation appears to come back to old structures and values. The goal of the film is to encourage viewers to start questioning. Nothing is what it seems is the message which the film wants to convey using the unusual mean of the black light.

Three Relationship Studies (Manipulations, Imitations, Shadow Play) brings together three conceptual exercises in which Acconci explores one of his main themes of interest: the body as space.
