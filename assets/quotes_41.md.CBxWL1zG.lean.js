Here, they prepare with Buddhist tranquility and cheerful black humour for what the afterlife may bring. They speak openly and without fear about the life that will soon end, and about the journey that they are about to embark on. The only thing they are afraid of is that they might come back as ghosts. Therefore, it's important for the old ladies to say farewell to their loved ones and to face death on their own, without being attached to anything in this world. This is something that has to be done, but it isn't always easy. But they do have each other's good company, and the result is a cheerful, funny and wonderfully life-affirming film.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Jawani Zindabaad","tagline":"","description":"Raj falls in love with Prabhjot who is in the good books of her family, but will she break the traditional norms of her family and fall in love?","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Lu Pikir La Sendiri De Movie","tagline":"","description":"Nabil (Nabil Raja Lawak 2), an SPM qualifier, is a hard working delivery boy.

Flaubert recorded his impressions of the trip in a notebook. This film attempts to follow these annotations, which form the backdrop to the story and provide a link with present-day Corsica. The mix of black and white historical photographs and colour images taken with a camera obscura, together with sound, show the different places Flaubert visited.  The filmed sequences bear witness to the reality of today's island and its inhabitants. Gustave Flaubert's memories coincide with the everyday life of Corsica today.  The camera has researched the places he visited on his journey, met the inhabitants, as Flaubert did in his time, and is trying to determine whether his impressions of the time are still valid.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Following the light","tagline":"","description":"No description found","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Going Stag","tagline":"They're Two Big Boobs!","description":"In this slapstick send up of early sexploitation films, two out-of-work Vaudeville performers unknowingly sign on to produce a stag reel when they are hired to helm a production by big shot producer Hal Zito.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/8/9/3/3/1/989331-going-stag-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=d01cf31411"},{"name":"Grand Teton & Yellowstone","tagline":"","description":"Explore the mountain scenery, wildlife and geology of two national parks.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Herr Berner und die Wolokolamsker Chaussee","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"High 5","tagline":"","description":"Transworld Surf has made another surf video, and yes, it's gonna be mental!

This is what causes ice to float on top of water, instead of collecting on the bottom, which makes all the difference for aquatic life and in fact for all life on earth.

The papyrus reed grows on the banks of Lake Tana, a lake that lies at 1850 metres above sea level and through which the Blue Nile flows, by more than 4000 km far from the river ' s mouth. The local inhabitants use the long stems of this plant to build their boats. Bundles of dried papyrus, laid end to end with a slight overlap, are lashed to an untrimmed pole of eucalyptus wood that acts as a sort of keel. Its length depends on the end use : from 1 metre for those built for children, up to 12 metres for the largest that are used to transport cargoes of wood, fish or as ferries carrying a dozen passengers from one bank of the Nile to the other.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/2/8/6/4/3/1028643-tankwas-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=070a1f1285"},{"name":"Tr?dfolket","tagline":"","description":"Arvid has made a torch.

After he helped to oust the Shah of Iran and bring Ayatollah Khomeini to power, he was kidnapped and sentenced to death; the Ayatollah didnt like Daniels opposition to his political agenda. He existed for a time in torturous prison conditions. His cellmates were executed, but by the grace of God Daniel escaped to Turkey. It was there that he met a group of Iranian Christians.
