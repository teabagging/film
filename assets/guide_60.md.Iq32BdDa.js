The play is concerned with three young men, Len, Pete and Mark, and the scene of action shifts back and forth between Len's house and Mark's. Sometimes all three come together, sometimes only two, and often Len is on stage alone. There are conversations and soliloquies filled with the brilliant convolutions of thought, the sudden flashes of truth which distinguish Pinter's unique style, with the mood ranging from calm introspection to explosive outpouring. Much of what is said hints at deeper thoughts left unspoken, and the sense of horror and alienation which often emerges is a searing indictment of our life and times. We meet, we talk, we tear at each other, but our insularity is seldom penetrated. We are together but alone, as though life were a mirror which reflects only our own image.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/6/8/6/3/106863-the-dwarfs-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=5b25d09602"},{"name":"Children of Sal","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Looking for Leonard","tagline":"","description":"Ted, his girlfriend Jo, and his brother Johnny are small-time robbers in Montreal.

Using exquisitely deteriorating nitrate-based archival film, Morrison weaves a story from the remnants of disparate narratives. The episodes appear intermittently between the undulating pulse of the film's decay, the imagery compromised - yet made all the more poignant - by a dying celluloid medium, a rusted vessel carrying ghosts. Contrasting with the previous three sections, the final section is an original single-take contemporary aerial shot of the 'Graveyard of Ships' off of Staten Island, NY.
