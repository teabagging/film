The story harks back to a Scandinavian saga, situated in Gurre. King Waldemar loves the girl Tove, who is a mysterious character, connected to both the world of people and the world of birds. The queen is jealous and has Tove killed. The Wood Dove tells of this in a moving song and the king accuses God of cruelty. A nightmarish scene follows, of a fierce army killed in battle, which rampages like a horde of ghosts. The radiant dawn at the end of Gurre-Lieder shows the insignificance of human destiny compared to the power of nature.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/4/1/3/4/4/641344-schonberg-gurre-lieder-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=67942de20d"},{"name":"?kran","tagline":"","description":"Fatma is a young teacher in her own right during the years of oppression and fear following the September 12 coup.

The sign of the village of Lotochina represents until now a merchant with a cheese wheel on a board. The prince had then brought from Switzerland a cheese maker named Johan Mller who developed a cheese recipe, founded a cheese-making school and settled in Russia with his family. Today, we managed to find his descendants; they live and work in the Alps. And make cheese.

His music was born at the same time as the Soweto Riots and then fused in a strangely comfortable way with the punk musical explosion. His songwriting bloomed through the apartheid regime's darkest years and into the dawning of The New South Africa. James was a complex person, selfish whilst showing extraordinary selflessness, giving time and often what little money he had to those in need. He drew people in, everyone was a friend of James. He lived too the rock & roll lifestyle, his capacity for the jol as legendary and abstention foreign to his nature.
