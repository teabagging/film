In this enlightening interview, Khouri describes how spending years doing music video production in the '80s inspired her not only to write, but to write with a purpose. A passionate activist with a resume that includes Something to Talk About and her adaptation of Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, which she also directed, Khouri discusses in detail the pressure of living up to such early acclaim, what it's like to be a woman in the industry, and how the state of the world around you fuels and shapes your creative mindset. Also a frequent script doctor and former Writers Guild of America board member, Khouri delves into the ongoing issues facing the WGA, its membership, and its much-maligned arbitration process.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Dick Little","tagline":"Hes about to get everything he ever wanted, almost","description":"A loser man-child is granted what life would be like if he had cool friends, money, and women.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/7/4/1/9/5/1074195-dick-little-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=0de259139a"},{"name":"Die Biene Maja - Teil 10","tagline":"","description":"41.

Collaboratively conceived by director Brian J. Johnson and Vancouvers acclaimed Company 605, Future Futures is a collection of five short dance films that explore the digital destiny of humankind through a unique merging of camera and visual effects with a specific choreographic vision. Embracing the absurdity of centering dance inside a sci-fi narrative, the experimental series collapses time to portray human culture at an unprecedented moment: the emergence of a new, autonomous, and intelligent beingthe digital reflection and culmination of ourselves. Through its otherworldly imagery, choreography, and driving electronic sound score, Future Futures evolves into a strange, highly visual exploration of what we are if we are no longer tied to our physical bodies, and how we will define humanity when faced with a fading IRL existence.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"The Mask","tagline":"The doors are all locked...","description":"Gianna is locked in the basement with mysterious masked men, as the three others try to break in and save the day.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/5/0/5/9/7/950597-the-mask-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=981eb22b62"},{"name":"Nishana","tagline":"","description":"Two unemployed young boys arrive at a railway track for committing suicide.
