His own saxophone playing appears to be an extension of the expressive and experimental character found in his paintings, drawings, constructions, and video works.  Rivers is shown at work in his New York studio. He examines a series of his Dutch Masters paintings, inspired by the standard cigar-box image which recalls Rembrandt, as well as several of his iconoclastic portraits. Among these are his naked renditions of the late poet and critic Frank O'Hara and the bold double images of his former mother-in-law, Berdie.

This time, documentary film maker Kowalski chooses the seemingly quiet Polish landscape, a land chosen for gas drilling, making a careful examination through a cautious revision of the tracks left on the fields and the sincere confessions of discontentment of the farmers who witnessed the terrifying consequences of the intervention of great international corporations in the fields of Poland. The landscape in this resource-exploited land is infested by an invisible menace. With a special interest in the gaze of the oppressed, Kowalski delivers a somehow melancholic film, revealing a declaration of love to the land and nature before they go into oblivion.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/8/2/2/0/8/182208-holy-field-holy-war-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=4b7efa3c2a"},{"name":"Memory Body","tagline":"","description":"Thought communicates with the body and writes upon it its own emotions by incessantly retrieving contents from memory.

Thus, the idiom of the body is the inexplicable language of memory.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/9/9/2/7/9/499279-memory-body-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=62eaa3c52c"},{"name":"The Invention","tagline":"","description":"A man struggling with his sexuality crosses paths with a student working on a time travel device which takes him to AN alternate universe and leads to his seduction.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/4/1/1/3/2/541132-the-invention-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=0601179ecc"},{"name":"American Beatboxer","tagline":"","description":"On July 31, 2010in Brooklyn, New York, the first ever American Beatbox Championship took place.
