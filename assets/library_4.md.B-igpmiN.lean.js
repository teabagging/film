The film begins with the words \\"Last year, my grandfather died,\\" and the filmmaker turns his attention to his grandmother, who is left behind. She says she could die at any time, but she lives on. The artist's fingers crawl over the grandmother's face, caressing the wrinkles. Her mother supports her as she gives her a bath. The artist, who says that one cannot avoid one's own blood or family when thinking about oneself, tries to question one's own existence by looking at the grandmother.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/9/8/8/6/7/598867-home-return-to-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=698079bec8"},{"name":"Lontano da dove","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/4/3/9/7/6/143976-lontano-da-dove-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=bad10d13a3"},{"name":"War","tagline":"","description":"1985:- England has been invaded by the Warsaw Pact countries and middle-class couple Hermine and Godfrey retreat to their rural hide-away but after witnessing a bunch of incompetent commandos kill each other, they get separated.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/9/7/9/4/9/1097949-war-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=65de79e0f5"},{"name":"Prince: 1999 Live In Houston 12/29/82","tagline":"","description":"Prince and the Revolution perform live at the Summit in Houston, TX on 12/29/1982","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/7/8/1/0/0/578100-prince-1999-live-in-houston-12-29-82-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=a1fa1aa8ff"},{"name":"Ana Mendieta: Selected Film Works","tagline":"","description":"Some of the films are presented in tandem in darkened interiors that resemble the caves where Mendieta sculpted some of her final works.

A human-faced growth speaks to her from between her legs, constantly berating her, calling out \\"Woman, you are worthless!\\" Mr. Koga, as she names it, continues the verbal abuse, yet Frances-ko somehow adapts, forming an adversarial yet symbiotic relationship. This bizarre film, based on Kaoruko Himeno's acclaimed 1997 novel of the same name, is skillfully directed by Ryoko Yoshida, lensed by veteran cinematographer Akiko Ashizawa, grounded by Iwasa's show-stopping performance and enlivened by the hilarious Kanji Furutachi, who lends his voice to the chauvinistic Koga. The soundtrack boasts an unmissable eclectic score by legendary experimental musician and composer Otomo Yoshihide.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/9/8/5/8/7/198587-passion-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=2f433fa678"},{"name":"In Sarmatien","tagline":"","description":"Volker Koepp revisits locations and people from his earlier documentaries in the wide Eastern European region of Sarmatia.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/8/8/1/1/2/188112-in-sarmatien-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=2bd266cdab"},{"name":"Ugly, Me?","tagline":"","description":"Ugly, Me? is a film manifesto made from a workshop for actors called Characters in Search of a Movie, in 'La pa', 'Rio De Janeiro', extended to Paris and 'Kerala' (India).

With remarkable honesty, good humor, great music and real heart, Inlaws & Outlaws weaves together true stories of couples and singles, gay and straight, to embrace what we all have in common: we love.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/4/9/2/8/6/149286-inlaws-outlaws-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=73e3827948"},{"name":"And Thereafter","tagline":"","description":"A documentary following the life of a Korean woman who came to the USA when she married a GI after the Korean War.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Aaliyah: So Much More Than a Woman","tagline":"","description":"The life story of Aaliyah, a worldwide-famous singer, actress and model who first rose to stardom in the 90s at age 15 and was later killed in a plane crash in 2001.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/5/4/7/6/3/254763-aaliyah-so-much-more-than-a-woman-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=8c48a1df95"},{"name":"Villa Paranoia","tagline":"","description":"Anna, a young and aspiring actress who has not had much success, offers to care for the father of Jorgen, who has been burdened with the responsibility.

That tendency, nurtured by the filmmakers carefully crafted succession of visual teases and exploited by the camera's ability to become our eyes, becomes in increasingly evident as the film progresses. The camera teases the viewer, in this case, co-voyeur, not with sexual or erotic innuendo, but rather with graphic and aesthetic challenges. The partially opened window of a woman's dressing room forces us to realize our urge to see more about these hidden worlds. This type of cinematically- induced self- realization makes Voyeuristic Tendencies a powerfully human film.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"The Chelsea Murders","tagline":"","description":"When a barmaid and part-time model becomes a murderer's third victim in Chelsea, the only apparent links are to a local reporter, Mary, and three art graduates financing a film with local part-time jobs.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/5/6/3/4/7/156347-the-chelsea-murders-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=738ef3dc29"},{"name":"The Last Duel","tagline":"","description":"Lu Shao Fung and Seeman Chelsea start a sword duel over one of the men's wives.

Over five days the Worlds leading mountain runners undertook an incredible adventure across wild, trackless, remote and mountainous terrain. Very few made it to the finishing line and the legend of the Dragon's Back Race? was born.  Twenty years later 84 runners from 15 countries are lining up in Conwy Castle looking to repeat the feat.  Many had considered the 1992 Dragon's Back Race? to be the toughest mountain running event ever organised. However, the 2012 route was harder still and included all the Welsh 3,000ft mountains on the first day, a number of additional summits on the other days and less road running throughout as the course weaves through the stunning Welsh mountains.  The Dragon's Back Race? is one of the hardest mountain races in the World.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/5/3/6/2/2/153622-dragon-s-back-race-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=bce020de9b"}]`),I={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:H},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:W,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},D={class:"card-container"},L=["disabled"],F={key:0},R={key:1};function P(s,i,t,c,h,o){const m=f("PoemCard");return a(),n("section",null,[i[1]||(i[1]=e("div",{class:"top-banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[e("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎬 Movie Showcase 🥳")])],-1)),e("div",D,[(a(!0),n(u,null,b(o.visiblePoems,(l,p)=>(a(),y(m,{key:p,poem:l},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),o.hasMorePoems?(a(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:h.isLoading,onClick:i[0]||(i[0]=(...l)=>o.loadMore&&o.loadMore(...l))},[h.isLoading?(a(),n("span",R,"Loading...")):(a(),n("span",F,"See more"))],8,L)):w("",!0)])}const G=d(I,[["render",P],["__scopeId","data-v-e3c34327"]]),O=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/4.md","filePath":"library/4.md"}'),E={name:"library/4.md"},K=Object.assign(E,{setup(s){return(i,t)=>(a(),n("div",null,[v(G)]))}});export{O as __pageData,K as default};
