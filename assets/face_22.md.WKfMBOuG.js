What Jerome Hiler accomplishes with this brief film is little short of alchemy. Everyday objects, places, thing, and people are transformed into integers of light, creating a sinuous tapestry of restless imagistic construction. Acid Rock (so named because a huge rock with the word \\"acid\\" emblazoned on it drifts briefly past the camera during the opening moments of the film) displays the best qualities of abstract expressionist experimental cinema in that it transmutes perceptual reality into a zone of ineluctable transcendence, causing the images to perceptibly burst forth from the surface of the screen.\\" - WWD","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Aksl","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Box Number 2","tagline":"","description":"Various images appear now and then from a box.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"The Dance of Life","tagline":"","description":"The Dance of Life features the extended monologue of a first-generation Canadian woman.

The wall that separates West Berlin from East Berlin is considered a crime against humanity. The truth is that the wall has caused many tragedies, the people on both sides of it are hermetically sealed off from each other. Those who are indignant about the existence of the wall, base their opinion entirely on the propaganda, which in the Cold War game manipulated the background to its creation. The film shows how necessary it was for East Germany to effectively close its border and the consequences of that for West Berlin.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/7/8/5/4/9/578549-berlin-divided-city-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=c217bf1170"},{"name":"Dudaktan Silaha","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/2/3/4/7/8/923478-dudaktan-silaha-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=e36778db93"},{"name":"In the Nick of Time","tagline":"","description":"In the Nick of Time is a Hong Kong Crime movie starring Stanley Fung.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/2/7/8/2/0/727820-in-the-nick-of-time-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=4de2df2927"},{"name":"Rolanda Polonsky, Sculptor","tagline":"","description":"Enter the imaginative world of acclaimed sculptor Rolanda Polonsky, who had been a resident of Netherne Psychiatric Hospital in Coulsdon, Surrey for 26 years when this film was made.
