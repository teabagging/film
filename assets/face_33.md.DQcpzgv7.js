This Qigong specializes in training the five internal Yin organs; heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, and spleen, which correspond to the four seasons the year. It is believed that when we get sick it is often due to the body s difficulty in adapting to the changes from one season to another.

Hercules in Polesine is a journey through time and into the sea.  The entertaining journey through 5,000 years of stories, myths, legends that tell us about horned and cheating gods, listless heroes and  mythomaniacs, of desperate and blustering men.  And all these stories make us think about how we are now, all that way we have (not) done from the beginnings of civilization to the aftermath of the ATM queue.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/9/4/6/6/8/694668-ercole-in-polesine-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=76b2f99bbf"},{"name":"Alain Tanner, pas comme si, comme ?a","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Why We Can't See Each Other Outside When the Sun is Shining","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Keine Angst vorm Atom!","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Capistrano no Quilo","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/1/8/1/4/2/1018142-capistrano-no-quilo-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=b754adee3f"},{"name":"Meine Mutter tanzend","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/3/5/6/7/7/235677-meine-mutter-tanzend-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=41e318de17"},{"name":"Chechnya No Politics","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/1/0/2/9/1/710291-cecenija-savam-acim-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=de6908e805"},{"name":"Paolo Gioli: Free Films Made Freely","tagline":"","description":"Feature-length retrospective interview with Italian avant-garde filmmaker Paolo Gioli.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Alphabet","tagline":"A short film inspired by Jeffrey Lewis' songs.","description":"A short film inspired by Jeffrey Lewis' songs.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"The Easiest Targets","tagline":"","description":"Five women C Palestinian, American, Muslim, Christian, and Jewish C tell stories of humiliation and harassment by Israeli border guards and airport security officials.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Was hei?t hier Oma!","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/8/4/2/3/48423-was-heit-hier-oma--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=d6f0803637"},{"name":"The 2006 Academy Award Nominated Short Films: Animation","tagline":"","description":"Collective screening of the Academy Award nominated short films from the Animation category for 2006.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Invasion of the Motorcycles: Laconia Biker Rally","tagline":"","description":"Experience all the thrills of Laconia, New Hampshire's annual Motorcycle Week, from touring bikes, custom rigs and vintage bike races to the artists, photographers and colorful personalities that make the annual trek to this premier biking event.

Launched just after the end of World War II, the ship first made history in 1947 when it fired a captured German rocket from a moving platform.  During the Vietnam War, aviators from the Midway shot down the first thee MiGs credited to the U.S. forces. And in the first Gulf War, the veteran carrier played in integral role in the deployment of sorties into the Persian Gulf before it was finally decommissioned in San Diego, California, in 1992.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/0/1/6/5/7/201657-uss-midway-the-hero-ship-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=2acf93a68c"},{"name":"Cosi Fan Tutte","tagline":"","description":"There are elements of Eurotrash in this outdoor Aix-en-Provence summer opera production.

Act One begins with the principal characters running around in the outdoor theater -- while the audience takes it in as if they had been advised to sit back and enjoy the novelty. Very likely they were also asked to refrain from applauding at the end of arias and ensemble pieces, in which the three-hour opera abounds.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/7/4/6/2/4/574624-cosi-fan-tutte-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=fdcded41f9"},{"name":"O Cine Rex e Ns","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/8/8/0/1/5/1088015-o-cine-rex-e-nos-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=77fdd9afde"},{"name":"Eva Zacharias","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/6/0/7/3/9/260739-eva-zacharias-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=a390bf54f1"},{"name":"Ancient & Medieval Worlds Series: Medieval World","tagline":"","description":"After The Fall: Medieval European world.

One year after the slaughter, they find themselves trapped beween gangs of Rwandan war criminals in control of the refugee camps and their country's new masters, who show little interest in reconciliation.

The tragedy shocked everyone involved in the 1986 event, but it was decided to complete the rally raid in Sabine's honour. So, 22 days after leaving Paris, the surviving cars, motorcycles and trucks rolled into Dakar, bringing an emotional end to the 15,000km adventure.  Treacherous terrain, wild weather, confusion and controversy made 1986 one of the toughest years for the Dakar Rally, with just 81 of the 478 competitors making the finish.

It had been thought Timo Salonen would lead the Peugeot team to another win. However, he was eclipsed by a brilliant drive from the former world champion. Nevertheless, Salonen and the Peugeot are established as the champions for 1985. This video graphically illustrates the hazards the drivers had to face, not least being the huge clouds of dust and the almost suicidally reckless spectators who were nearly as dangerous as the notorious crowds in Portugal.  The Lancias made a welcome comeback and added colour to an event, which turned out more a test of stamina than predicted. Rohrl can be seen hurling the big Quattro through the mountains sometimes defying the laws of gravity in his urgency to see off the little French turbos. On the gravel or tarmac, San Remo belonged to Rohrl.

These colors are overlaid onto images of the famous canyons of the American Southwest: Zion, Bryce, and the Grand Canyon. As is common with travel films, Flaming Canyons ranges across multiple scenic highlights, condensing a trip that would take several days in person into a running time of just over 13 minutes on screen. The purpose of such films was two-fold: to promote actual tourism to the region, and more broadly, to provide a vicarious tourist experience for the audience in the movie theater.
