It was a shot of a train pulling into Tokyo Station from Ozus The Only Son (1936). So I decided to make a film around this shot, an anthology of train arrivals. It comprises 26 scenes or shots from movies, 1904-2015. It has a simple serial structure: each black & white sequence in the first half rhymes with a color sequence in the second half. Thus the first shot and the final shot show trains arriving at stations in Japan from a low camera height.

For most of recorded history, the human body was the measure of all things. Constant asks what led measurement to depart from the body and become a science unto itself. The film explores three shifts in the history of measurement standardization, from the land surveying that drove Early Modern European land privatization, to the French Revolution that drove the Metric Revolution, to the conceptual dematerialisation of measurement in the contemporary era of Big Science. Each chapter traces the relationship of measurement standardization to ideas of egalitarianism, agency, justice, and power. Cinematic and technical images that begin as products of measurement systems are stretched beyond their functions to describe the resistance of lived experience to symbolic abstractions.","rating":"","theme":"Relationship comedy","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/2/9/6/5/2/829652-constant-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=c6e94cbeea"},{"name":"In Flow of Words","tagline":"","description":"A short experimental film about the piercing experiences of three interpreters of the Yugoslavia Tribunal in The Hague and their position as a channel between speakers and listeners, witnesses and defendants, judges and attendees.","rating":"3.46","theme":"Quirky and endearing relationships","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/6/1/0/0/7/761007-in-flow-of-words-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=4f8e69550a"},{"name":"Hero","tagline":"You cannot be a hero without being a coward","description":"A barber decides to kill his ex-girlfriend, who is married to a mafia head.
