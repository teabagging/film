This short documentary uses three cinematographers to shoot different protagonists at the same time to discover the unique character and story of each protagonist, and tries to find the connection between the protagonists. The film is divided into three parts: first acquaintance, acquaintance and departure, which expresses the change of the relationship between our shooting team and the protagonist, as well as their change of attitude towards the camera. The film contains many themes and stories, such as poverty, children's desire for the city, school bullying, underage work and a series of issues. Overall, the film not only shows the audience the real life of these children living in rural China, but also provides a channel for these children to pour out their secret thoughts to the camera.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"There Are No Monuments To Monuments","tagline":"","description":"A monument married a catastrophe and then died, and now catastrophe is left alone, she gets drunk and grins, she is not going anywhere.

And if we fail to conform to the new regime and instead use yesterdays pronouns, we may be punished with ostracism; unemployment, or even prosecution.  This new maze of gender identity is confusing to navigate and contrary to reason and revealed truth. On this special program, you will discover the worldview that lies beyond the new gender confusion and find out how it is especially harming children and women. The Tragedy of Gender Confusion exposes how radical ideologues are working to drive a governmental wedge between parents and children, and how the new gender orthodoxy is being exactingly policed in our culture. And you will meet someone who transitioned to another gender - but then was transformed by an encounter with Jesus Christ.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/4/8/1/9/2/948192-the-tragedy-of-gender-confusion-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=15d95221c0"},{"name":"Transe","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/5/5/9/6/9/1055969-transe-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=14aa930f5b"},{"name":"transe parte 2","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/5/6/0/1/0/1056010-transe-parte-2-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=4f5870659b"},{"name":"Trauma in These Walls","tagline":"","description":"A filmmaker returns to a house from his past where a great tragedy happened, in order to find a closure within the space that already feels too foreign.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/2/3/8/5/0/1123850-trauma-in-these-walls-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=18e25ea3f9"},{"name":"Trax: The Evolution of Snow Bikes","tagline":"","description":"Trax \\"Evolution of snow bikes\\" will inspire most any adventure enthusiast while providing you with an in depth look at the history of the \\"Snow Bike\\" sport and beyond.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/5/0/0/4/5/350045-trax-the-evolution-of-snow-bikes-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=c856769ef0"},{"name":"Trek to Neverland","tagline":"","description":"Ekansh, witnesses the havocs of finding a political voice in India when a peaceful college protest turns into a riot.

It pays attention to the usage, movements, and possibility of variations of the diverse 'distances' that exist between them. If it takes a long time to move from one scene to the next, and if there are things that can only be seen after some time or from a distance, the 'time-distance' is necessary for an image to appear and disappear. What if this work captures this 'time-distance'? When a scene/image contains a single space-time, it might enable different time-space, objects, matter, non-matter in a far distance to meet, even for a brief time. Based on such ideas, the work connects one scene to the next, the voices of anonymous speakers to another. It captures the distance and the sense of distance of the things that do not stay and cannot be reached. By doing so, it seeks possible formless connections and temporary coexistence.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"The Weight of the Sky","tagline":"","description":"Year 2020, the year of the pandemic and lockdowns.
