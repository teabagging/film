To call the atmosphere uncomfortable is an understatement, and things only get worse when Sara announces she's pregnant, which is quite troubling for Jan since he's been waiting for the right time to tell her he had a vasectomy several months before.","rating":"","theme":"Horror, the undead and monster classics","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/8/9/9/9/48999-messy-christmas-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=cb82d3a672"},{"name":"Jekyll + Hyde","tagline":"Think You Know The Story?

Yet another school (Tendai) emphasized complex metaphysics and the study of philosophical systems. Basically, all of them were designed to cater to the few who were able to give up everything else in their lives and focus on liberation, such as scholars and noblemen.

In 2005 this former industrial zone was designated a residential area and the factories, manufacturers and artistslofts were priced out by property speculators lured by tax breaks. Friedrich spent five years documenting with her camera the changes in the area. She shows the demolition of industrial buildings and the construction of trendy new apartments for wealthy clients, watching old tenants leave and new inhabitants arrive. As she keeps meticulous record of developments, the extent and speed of the upheaval becomes clear.
