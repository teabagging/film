Janzs self-erasing word paintings challenge the serendipitous viewer to reflect on the contradictory nature of artistic practices that often capture and immortalize both a fleeting moment in time and the mortal artist that captured it.  In capturing this story of the artist at work, the film evokes Janzs philosophical musings on practicing an art form that is very much a metaphor for his own mortality.
