Final goodbyes from life are universally painful and difficult, and Neuenschwander's sensitive film subtly reminds us of our own mortality.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/4/6/6/1/9/1146619-sooner-or-later-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=1822c0e163"},{"name":"Doc and Merle Watson in Concert","tagline":"","description":"Doc is joined by his son Merle on guitar and banjo and T.

The fig plants grow directly there, so they are initially epiphytes. But their aerial roots grow down to the ground. When the roots reach the ground, the figs begin to grow faster and form many more aerial roots. They gradually enclose their supporting or host tree, which eventually dies, forming a cavity inside the strangler fig. The strangler fig also benefits from the nutrients released during the decomposition of the dead supporting tree.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/3/4/6/3/3/834633-strangler-figs-the-deadly-grasp-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=54c9f884de"},{"name":"Street Running","tagline":"","description":"To railfans, \\"street running\\" brings to mind images of long trains operating down busy city streets while auto traffic swerves to avoid disastrous collisions.

This collection seeks to reassure surviving Aboriginal Australians that there is a living continuity of traditions. -Ronin Films","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"It's a Lezzie Life: A Dyke-u-mentary","tagline":"","description":"Zooms into the lives of four lesbian roomies who are daffy caricatures of very conflicting dyke lifestyles.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Jubileum","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Nenechvejte mu?e samotnho doma","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/2/1/0/6/0/721060-nenechavejte-muze-samotneho-doma-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=d97820567e"},{"name":"Now Playing","tagline":"","description":"Explores the various memories and fantasies of a group of gay men who frequent an old movie house, seeking an understanding of their collective past, and uncertain future.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Ohnsorg Theater - Wenn du Geld hast","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/9/3/4/6/7/193467-ohnsorg-theater-wenn-du-geld-hast-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=1fb704d79b"},{"name":"Omyl doktora Moresiniho","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Psychogenesis","tagline":"","description":"Umkehr Film Material.
