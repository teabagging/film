He goes to the police to turn himself in, but they ignore him. As night falls, the man is in despair and is drawn to the soft voice of a radio DJ, to whom he confesses, adding that he will commit suicide tomorrow at 6pm. Unaware that his confession has become a hot topic, the man wanders the streets at night in search of the girlfriend he loved in middle school. He calls the DJ to inform him that he does not intend to die, but the DJ asks him to come to the place where he promised to commit suicide. This film is part of the low-budget digital experimental film project Super City. Born in Shanghai, but raised in Urumqi, the main character is unable to adapt to life in a big city. The sound design, filled with radio noise, and the canted angles, reveal the psychology of a person trapped in the huge but closed-off city.

The 'from behind' approach was suggested by the logic of the film itself. The narrative dissonance of the original film is amplified in Back to Front, the antinomy of law and desire patent. Moving in reverse, cause cruises outcome, with often queer effects. For instance, straight intercourse isnt an anodyne for gay sex, but a push towards it, and hetero-normativity longs for sexual lawlessness. The act that haunts the redo is the one that incites it: Karen Allen donning Pacinos S&M leather gear and lurking, 'dragging', up behind him on the soundtrack. Upshot: Feminized desire, non-localizable, not-all, betrays the underlying, real, phobia in Friedkin's quasi-horror film 'How would you like to disappear?'\\"  Robert Buck","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Girl Talk","tagline":"","description":"When Elisa gets home to the suburbs after a hard day at work and calls a lesbian phone-sex line she expects to get into one of her fantasies and have some fun.

One of the little sons is practicing the violin. As he plays, Couzin focuses in on his arm and bow connecting with the violin strings. The image is shot with 8mm film using a 16mm camera and optical printed back up to 16mm. The result is a strong repetitious gesture created by splitting the original image in half through the shooting process. When projected, the upper and lower halves of the image are shown alternately, creating an intense visual rhythm which causes the action to blur. As the boy's movements become relentlessly frantic, we can almost hear the strained screeches of the instrument. Perceptually there is no sound but the visual tension created causes us to experience the image as though we are hearing him play. We experience form of synesthesia, and the rhetoric is effective: the discomfort is so great we want the boy to stop.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"The years of rage","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/2/8/0/5/9/928059---0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=f66b1e9316"},{"name":" ҧӧ֧ߧߧާ ا֧ݧѧߧڧ","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/6/5/1/0/8/565108---0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=5a3553c6e9"},{"name":"Sakthi","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/3/8/0/9/7/438097-sakthi-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=bf83895674"},{"name":"Jugend einer Studienr?tin","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"About Us","tagline":"","description":"In Fall of 1971, artist Robert Frank came to Rochester, NY to conduct a course on filmmaking at the recently established alternative art school, Visual Studies Workshop.

In need of money to shoot his next film, Frank proposed a non-traditional course to friend Nathan Lyons, suggesting the students work together to make their own movie with Frank acting as more of a collaborator than an instructor. Franks approach to working with the group of six students was simple: load up a camera and start shooting the world around you, including yourselves. The resulting 38 minute film is a valuable portrait of a creative collaboration between artists, and a stimulating document of what Frank refers to as the chaos of the present.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Dean Reed - S?nger des anderen Amerika","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Routine Performance","tagline":"","description":"A short piece done in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, 1972","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"...Aval!","tagline":"","description":"Chandranath, a writer by profession impresses a rich girl, Geetha with his writings.
