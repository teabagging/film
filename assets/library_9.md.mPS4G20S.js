When the best man eventually does show up, he causes a few problems since he ran through some tar just before entering the church. The groom doesn't seem to mind too much, just as long as the best man brought the ring, which he did.

That havoc, which leads into the reception, the wedding night and the honeymoon send off, may end the marriage even before it begins... or at least the couple's friendship with their best man.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/3/6/9/3/6/136936-the-best-man-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=9cf7b844b6"},{"name":"The Police Quartette","tagline":"","description":"At the police station, four Hollywood cops sing \\"Skinna-Ma Rink-A-Dink,\\" \\"Mother Goose Medley,\\" \\"Cluckin'\\" and \\"Waddle.\\"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Cut It Out","tagline":"","description":"An intrusive censor interferes with the filming of a melodrama.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/7/2/9/8/8/272988-cut-it-out-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=1c61d2d292"},{"name":"Strandgut","tagline":"","description":"A woman is rescued after a shipwreck by two fishermen and falls in love with one of them, whereupon the other jealousy attempts a fratricide and other intrigues.
