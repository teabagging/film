Armed with a stolen jeep, the youngsters deal successfully in stolen goods, with Hans doing a good impression of a G.I. Business is so good, in fact, that when someone arrives to encourage Hans to get into the big-time with stolen vehicles and U.S. Army uniforms, the first crisis comes up in the small gang. Members want to back away from that level of dangerous dealing, but Hans wants to go for broke -- a difficult decision that will determine the young con's future.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/9/1/9/6/49196-kolp-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=5f95c355e3"},{"name":"Cucumber Horse","tagline":"","description":"The story of the girl, Masha, who grows a cucumber in the garden and protects it, with the help of a dog, from a goat, a rooster and a crow.

The mellifluous Riverdance Orchestra boasts Davy Spillane, who coaxes plaintive lamentations out of a peculiar instrument that resembles a bagpipe in a metal leg brace. For Enya fans, there is the sound-alike choral group Anuna, who casts a similarly New Age-style vocal spell. Also thrown into the mix are such disparate folk traditions as American gospel and Spanish flamenco. Though it's only 70 minutes long, Riverdance is repetitive by half.

Like Recital, the film is also highly structured and revolves around the reading of various texts.  It involves two 'characters', a woman and a man, who, according to Beroes, carry on a 'disjunctive conversation about the effects of illness on perception. While the man reads from a scientific treatise on the syndrome of fever, the woman chooses the words of Merleau-Ponty, explaining her experience in phenomenological terms. They show each other film footage in an attempt to visualise/exchange their perceptions. But ultimately the film confirms their inability to 'see eye to eye'.' In her choice of cinema as a medium of 'exchange' within the film, Beroes also points to the dilemma of the artist and the problematics of communicating one's singular vision to the larger world.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/5/3/2/6/7/253267-valley-fever-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=d8bb8dcf22"},{"name":"Donde hay patrn...","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/7/7/5/2/7/377527-donde-hay-patron--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=4424f71fb1"},{"name":"Pauline et l'ordinateur","tagline":"","description":"Seeking medical advice to lose a few pounds, a woman lands up finding out about the usefulness of a computer, not just for her diet but also for work, with her parents,and to find a new boyfriend after the previous one has left her.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/9/4/2/6/1/494261-pauline-et-l-ordinateur-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=52a6a13e37"},{"name":"The Fall of Idols","tagline":"","description":"A teacher in a remote village gets hindered by zealot members of the community who still believe in old superstitions.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/9/3/8/2/8/393828-the-collapse-of-idols-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=7599c658de"},{"name":"Robert Klein Revisited","tagline":"","description":"Robert Klein returns to HBO for another hour of his classic comedy.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/9/7/2/0/79720-robert-klein-revisited-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=8a718e49f5"},{"name":"Pankararu de Brejo dos Padres","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/9/4/7/9/8/594798-pankararu-do-brejo-dos-padres-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=13120ba8a9"},{"name":"Kill for the Truth","tagline":"","description":"In order to really see justice done, Mai (Sombat Metanee) leave his work as a lawman, and funds his activities with some thievery of his own.

Over the last 250 years, large-scale industry has increasingly capitalised on natural resources in a process where the mapping of the forest has been singularly focused on reducing both land and trees to raw materials.
