The subsequent dictatorial regime with fascist features brought great violence and terror to the Chilean people. The accompanying neo-liberal economic system, which made the country one of the richest in the region, led to an ever-widening social gap in society, which in turn fell into a kind of passivity.

The videography employs experimental, high contrast exposures that will cause white pages to bleach away almost entirely, and black pages to intensify so that they become suggestive of spaces rather than surfaces; so that the diagrams/images on those pages seem to float in voids.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/1/5/9/0/9/615909-the-tent-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=c4d8dd59fc"},{"name":"The Sydney Convicts","tagline":"","description":"The camera follows Stuart, Brian and James as they go about their daily lives, revealing their individual journeys from childhood to manhood - trials and triumphs from the rugby pitch to the stage, Bondi Beach to the 'Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras'.
