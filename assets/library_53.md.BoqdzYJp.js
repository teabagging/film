The camerawork is so freaky one would almost suspect it is under the influence of heroin. The film includes interviews with Athey as well as shocking live fragments wherein Athey works his face over with injection needles. The crazy, maniacal clamour of the HIV positive priest/performer gives us insights into the motives and goals of this group of masochistic performance artists. Somebody who entertains his audience by cutting and stabbing himself; is this art? Who can say?

The largely unknown cast features Steve Lattery, Alex Cole, Cedric Yabrough and Joshua Will.  The foursome play a free-wheeling, competitive style of golf, frequently making use of the \\"mulligan\\" ( golfing for 'do over'), a technique each of them, not surprisingly, begin to regularly utilize in their everyday (non-golfing) comings-and-goings, with predictably disastrous results.

A shared enemy serves to reunite the once-happy group however, and they drive off into the sunset on golf carts.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/7/1/6/0/2/171602-mulligan-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=98ac81f6a9"},{"name":"Ene bene","tagline":"","description":"Alice Nellis's small-scale debut tragicomedy spotlights small-town elections.

While there they closed the gates upon him and set watchmen to defend them, intending to put him to death on the following day. Samson slept until midnight, and then arose. Upon reaching the gates, he slew the watchman, pulled down the gates and carried them to the top of an adjoining hill, where he left them to the confusion and disappointment of the Philistines. After many feats of this kind, Samson permitted himself to become infatuated with a treacherous woman among the Philistines, named Delila. He revealed to her that the secret of his strength lay in the fact that, being a Nazarite, he never had cut his hair. After hearing this, she waited until Samson was asleep, and then having cut off his seven locks, called out that the Philistines were coming.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Le chateau d'eau vu de la tour Eiffel","tagline":"","description":"Movement of visitors in front of the Exhibition water tower.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/2/2/2/7/8/722278-le-chateau-d-eau-vu-de-la-tour-eiffel-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=7b0eba998e"},{"name":"Evian : arrive dun bateau","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/6/3/6/7/2/763672-evian-arrivee-d-un-bateau-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=e1c2538b1e"},{"name":"Evian : procession de la Fte-Dieu IV","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/3/6/3/6/2/736362-evian-procession-de-la-fete-dieu-iv-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=f852539252"},{"name":"Fte du jubil de la reine d'Angleterre : la foule suivant le cortge","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/4/5/4/9/2/745492-fete-du-jubile-de-la-reine-d-angleterre-la-foule-suivant--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=a82e7e75d5"},{"name":"Roi d'Italie et prince Victor passant la revue","tagline":"","description":"King Umberto I and Prince Victor Emmanuel, followed by their escort, parade the troops standing at attention.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Armagedon","tagline":"A Story for the Ages","description":"The Flash leads the Heroes of the Arrowverse against Despero in an epic 5 Part Crossover.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Beach Villa","tagline":"","description":"a film by Kianoush Ayari","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/9/8/8/6/1/1098861---0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=a0669d26d0"},{"name":"Charlie and Lola, Vol. 8","tagline":"","description":"Charlie is missing only one dinosaur for his complete collection, but it's the hardest one to get, the Gigantasauras!
