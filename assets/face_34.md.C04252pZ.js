Since 1957, he has lived a reclusive life in America and harbours ambivalent feelings about his native Britain. Characteristically, he was not there to collect his 10,000 prize. It is impossible to label him as a painter, as he has always avoided association with the schools and styles of contemporary art, though he seems to have pioneered many of them.

In both of these personal performances, Cherkaoui connects the classical ballet technique with his own highly individual, 'fluid' contemporary dance idiom, which is steeped in countless influences. It is never about the movement itself, but always, the connection between two sequences. These create an eternal language of movement that also reflects the theme of flourishing and decline, loss and memory, in the dance.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Memrias Culinrias do Quilombo Ausente Feliz","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Memorias in casa","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/5/1/4/7/9/551479-memorias-in-casa-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=63704c4e37"},{"name":"Memories of D-Day","tagline":"","description":"Marking the 75th anniversary of D-Day, a special documentary explores the world-changing event through the incredible images and recollections of veteran photographers.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Memphis Slim  Live At Ronnie Scott's","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/1/7/5/2/111752-memphis-slim-live-at-ronnie-scott-s-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=10b4c3bded"},{"name":"Men Hard at Work 9","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Menneskesmuglerne","tagline":"","description":"Documentary following human smugglers in Africa","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Mercenaire","tagline":"","description":"Hired at a slaughterhouse thanks to a social reinsertion program, an ex-convict struggles to find another job while repressing the violence that boils within him.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Merikalastusta pienveneell?","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/1/8/9/2189-merikalastusta-pienveneella-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=d0ab67086e"},{"name":"Mermaid Faith","tagline":"","description":"the feminine knows how to wait, better than anything - waits to be fertilized, waits to give life.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"M'es en abyme","tagline":"","description":"A collage of images and voices of women poets that succeeds brilliantly, both as a tribute to the women whose words are borrowed and as an original videopoem.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/3/9/2/8/0/1039280-m-es-en-abyme-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=e6cd9477ad"},{"name":"Mess","tagline":"","description":"A deer hunter is followed by a red light","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/8/5/1/5/9/1185159-mess-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=176c479700"},{"name":"Messy Eater","tagline":"","description":"A messy eater gets taught some table manners.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"METH","tagline":"","description":"Two students whore charectorly innocents.
