Unfortunately, the situation got worse year by year, and in the film, a new huge wildfire now threatens to destroy the Outpost. Chris takes a gamble and decides to pit an equally spectacular event against the destruction of the forest: a Pink Floyd concert inside the green inferno, as a way to convince the Brazilian government to set up a nature reserve. To a dreamer like him, anything is possible, and he may well be right: in a world careening towards the apocalypse, being a bit crazy is the only form of resistance there is.
