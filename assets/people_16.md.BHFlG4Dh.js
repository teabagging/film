While Dickens is often celebrated for his powerful depictions of Victorian England and his role as a social reformer, this programme foregrounds the elements of his writing which make him worth reading, as much for what he tells us about ourselves in the twenty-first century as our ancestors in the nineteenth.

Filmmakers No?lle Ingeveldt and Juriaan van Berkel work together as Berkveldt to produce a sincere testimonial of a woman with a remarkable life story, filmed amongst the many dolls Ans made in the same likeness of her alien friends.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/0/3/3/3/5/1103335-ans-and-the-universe-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=fd708ee038"},{"name":"Blood Pizza","tagline":"Who took my blood pizza!?","description":"A group of friends decide to eat pizza out of bloody biohazard bag, but where did it come from and who does it belong to?!","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/1/4/7/8/1/1114781-blood-pizza-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=cd4c604562"},{"name":"Blondie in an Ancient Time","tagline":"","description":"Transported back to the nineteenth century by a strange cellphone, an entrepreneur is tricked into slavery and has to find a way back to the present day.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/7/1/4/6/5/971465-nang-that-hua-thong-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=3f6508918b"},{"name":"Not What I Asked For","tagline":"What if We Could Have More Time?","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/0/3/9/6/3/1103963-not-what-i-asked-for-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=a797f023b9"},{"name":"Les vivants","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/2/3/8/7/7/1123877-les-vivants-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=61475962bb"},{"name":"Sound Party","tagline":"","description":"A father-son duo embarks on a quest for wealth, launching a family-run restaurant.
