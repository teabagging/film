As in the earlier \\"Idomeneo\\", Mozart sought to produce an opera seria that was dramatically viable. He enlisted the poet Mazzol to substantially revise the Metastasio libretto, which had already been set some fifty times. The number of arias was reduced from 25 to 11, and ensembles and choruses were added to enliven the proceedings.

These technical dinosaurs become a document and an allegory of Wiesingers timeless imagination of travel.

Thus, the documentary focusses on the Americans less known later works and on three compositions in particular: his Mass, the musical 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and the great final opera A Quiet Place. The film paints a vivid picture of the multitalented Bernstein, struggling with his role as composer and conductor, tackling the tension between successes and flops, between the politics of his time and his own liberal humanitarian claim. It looks back on Bernsteins major achievements, such as his acclaimed conducting of Mahler and his involvement in the Young Peoples Concerts, and it shows Bernsteins work with young aspiring musicians as well as his political commitment.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/8/2/2/5/2/782252-leonard-bernstein-a-genius-divided-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=fc8240e162"},{"name":"Mute","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/1/7/6/7/2/417672-mute-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=738000579b"},{"name":"Murder House IIIIII","tagline":"","description":"A small house party goes horrifically wrong when a murder takes place.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/4/7/8/2/9/447829-murder-house-iiiiii-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=0633017a40"},{"name":"Outra Ode s Costureiras","tagline":"","description":"The documentary portrays the lives of 5 seamstresses from Blumenau facing dilemmas, pain and sequelae that their day-to-day work has left in their lives.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/9/5/4/7/5/895475-outra-ode-as-costureiras-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=d7161197e0"},{"name":"Remembering Agatha","tagline":"The hardest thing about being magical is pretending to be ordinary.","description":"For Agatha, Christmas triggers sadness.
