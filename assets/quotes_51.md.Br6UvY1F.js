Meanwhile, experts such as Michael White place today's countertenors in their historical context.  What emerges is a compelling portrayal of an unmistakable vocal style, rooted in church and operatic tradition, yet completely up-to-date, resonating louder today than at any time in the last two hundred years.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/1/1/2/3/8/511238-countertenors-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=6a4d923285"},{"name":"Sindak","tagline":"","description":"Sindak is a movie about four guys, security guards by night, sex maniacs by day, and in weekends, regular dudes who like to shoot the shit with gin and pulutan (gleaned from their weekend monkey-hunting trips).
