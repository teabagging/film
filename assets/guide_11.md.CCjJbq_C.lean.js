The film is composed in a braided structure, interweaving a pilgrimage, the production of anti-anxiety medication and the extraction of snake venom, all of which are linked to human strategies of defence against fear. In this film, as in numerous other popular myths, fear is incarnated by an animal. The image of the snake, an ambivalent symbol in many cultures (both lethal and protective), is used in this film as a recurring symbol of the most archetypal fears and their ability to be transformed in order to take part in the process of creation. The snake appears furtively through various works of art, as an obsessional, baroque and versatile icon. It becomes a thread between the East and the West, and contradicts the theoretical separation between these two cultural spheres.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/5/8/7/8/8/358788-the-strife-of-love-in-a-dream-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=285cfaa295"},{"name":"The Burningmoore Incident","tagline":"","description":"The cameras filming a TV pilot capture the brutal killings of a home renovation crew.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/6/8/0/9/9/568099-the-burningmoore-incident-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=257252bbf7"},{"name":"Brian Wilson: Songwriter 1962-1969","tagline":"","description":"A documentary film in which the rich tapestry of music written and produced by this brilliant 20th century composer is investigated and reviewed.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/2/5/5/4/9/125549-brian-wilson-songwriter-1962-1969-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=b12277e811"},{"name":"Lippels Traum","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/1/0/1/11101-lippels-traum-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=5114e45579"},{"name":"Yakuza Eiga, une histoire du cinma yakuza","tagline":"","description":"The history of the Yakuza Eiga at the TOEI studio is roughly outlined.

La belle dame sans merci follows a famous actress who was once seduced and abandoned by a rich man and subsequently resolved to become a merciless woman, forever scheming to hurt others (men in particular) in a ruthless yet captivating manner. Dulac challenges the Romantic archetype embodied in Keatss poem by way of symbolist mise en scne, self-reflexive narration, and her typically associative approach to editing, locating a modern ambiguity within the stereotypical figures of 19th-century art.\\" - Film Society of Lincoln Center","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/9/2/9/1/9/392919-la-belle-dame-sans-merci-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=ea2695e760"},{"name":"I Am Still Alive","tagline":"","description":"The story tells of a 16-year-old girl who is sent to live with her long-lost, and off-the-grid, father in the Canadian wilderness.
