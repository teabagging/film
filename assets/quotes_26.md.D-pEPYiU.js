The play of images is accompanied by excerpts of a special new recording of Morton Feldmans String Quartet No. 1 as performed by the virtuoso musicians of the Flux Quartet.

For many years the piece has been known as the national dance of Cura?ao. The music and its variations reflect the tragic history of the island and although the tunes are seemingly distant, they profoundly resemble Chopin's compositions. The film centers on Randal Corsen, the most outstanding local pianist, who  plans to write pieces inspired by Chopin, for traditional instruments and in some new arrangements. He is joined by Janusz Olejniczak, an internationally recognised composer, enthusiast and interpreter of Chopin's music. The artists intend to invite contemporary musicians from Cura?ao, who have not yet played Chopin, to perform the music together.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/3/4/6/8/2/834682-chopin-caribbean-key-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=de36480138"},{"name":"Chronological Ferry: The Tao Family","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/7/5/0/5/0/975050--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=7258e53da1"},{"name":"Days after","tagline":"","description":"In Isre, in the mountainous region of Trives, is the Tournesol farm, an experiential farm totally autonomous in energy, a veritable laboratory for renewable energies.
