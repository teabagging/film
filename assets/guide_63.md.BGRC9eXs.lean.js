Exploring the royal wardrobes of our kings and queens over the last four hundred years, Lucy shows this isn't just a public fascination, but an important and powerful message from the monarchs. From Elizabeth I to the present Queen Elizabeth II, Lucy explains how the royal wardrobe's significance goes far beyond the cut and color of the clothing. Royal fashion is, and has always been, regarded as a very personal statement to reflect their power over the reign. Most kings and queens have carefully choreographed every aspect of their wardrobe; for those who have not, there have sometimes been calamitous consequences. As much today as in the past, royal fashion is as much about politics as it is about elegant attire.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/8/4/2/9/6/384296-tales-from-the-royal-wardrobe-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=09b2e77326"},{"name":"Electric Blues","tagline":"","description":"\\"It's a poetic camera through Super 8 film which plays of the electric guitar in an increased vision of daydream!

This tantalising film-within-a-film serves to both deconstruct and pay affectionate homage to the often-maligned exploitation style.  Having created a full screenplay, score and cut-and-paste prototype for Hiker Meat, Shovlin filmed key sections and a full trailer in an intense shoot in the Lake District in summer 2013. Rough Cut contrasts these re-made sequences with on-set footage and insights into the development of Hiker Meats script, soundtrack and design, to create a compelling mash-up of self-referencing processes, behind-the-scenes viewpoints and time-honoured slasher tropes.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/7/0/6/6/0/170660-rough-cut-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=c8f5ab4f48"},{"name":"The Volunteer","tagline":"Is That All There Is?","description":"After quitting her stable but soul-crushing job, Leigh passes her days in an apathetic fog until she decides to volunteer at a soup kitchen.
