In the early 20th century, these classically trained composers transformed the methods acquired in Vienna and Berlin into a new American art form: film music. They balanced the relationship between image and sound and developed techniques and dramaturgical tricks to achieve the greatest possible effect on the viewer. Their influence is visible in the work of contemporary US composers such as John Williams and Jerry Goldsmith. Today, Oscar winner Hans Zimmer, Ramin Djawadi and Harold Faltermeyer continue this tradition. Their melodies are part of humanity's collective memory and reflect the combined traditions of European and American musical history.

Composed by Pauline Kim Harris and Spencer Topel  Deo is an acoustic-electronic transcription of Johannes Ockeghems stunning Deo Gratias devised as a complement to Ambient Chaconne. Notable as a 36-part canon, Ockeghem evokes singing of angels in heaven via an innovation on a traditional canon, using this ancient musical device as a kind of acoustic feedback delay. In essence, our Deo expands this idea of delays to a canon of thousands, in an ever expanding and infinite soundscape, where the melodies eventually dissolve into resonance.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/3/7/5/8/9/1037589-herione-deo-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=8e6b022865"},{"name":"Don Gino","tagline":"","description":"Once Don Gino discovers his son's homosexuality, he'll have to choose between family and respect.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/3/1/4/4/0/631440-don-gino-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=693260cdb0"},{"name":"Sou Pietra","tagline":"","description":"Short film about Pietra's life as a transsexual and her relationship with society and her mother's love","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/5/0/6/7/9/550679-sou-pietra-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=3a51ce32b4"},{"name":"One Little Finger","tagline":"","description":"An American neurologist (Tamela D'Amico) uproots her life to study music therapy in India and ends up helping people with disabilities by bringing them together through music.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/8/5/0/6/6/685066-one-little-finger-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=1feb92f541"},{"name":"Viyoga","tagline":"","description":"When his daughter prepares for college, a guilt-ridden man is haunted by his father he left in India.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/3/7/5/1/0/637510-viyoga-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=339131367c"},{"name":"American Hasi","tagline":"","description":"A part-time Indian-American comedian in the US sees an opportunity to fast track his career in India or else accept that comedy may just be a hobby.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/3/9/4/4/8/539448-american-hasi-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=9b5735e239"},{"name":"The Dominator","tagline":"Winning and losing is the way the world works!

But write a list of great guitarists and their finest moments and a quieter, more intense playing comes to the fore. The acoustic guitar is the secret weapon in the armoury of the guitar hero, when paradoxically they get more attention by playing quietly than being loud.  This documentary takes an insightful and occasionally irreverent look at the love affair between rock and the humble acoustic guitar. Exploring a much less celebrated, yet crucial part of the rock musician's arsenal, contributors including Johnny Marr, Keith Richards, Ray Davies, James Dean Bradfield, Biffy Clyro, Joan Armatrading, Donovan and Roger McGuinn discuss why an instrument favoured by medieval minstrels and singing nuns is as important to rock 'n' roll as the drums, bass and its noisy sister, the electric guitar.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/9/5/5/2/1/195521-when-rock-goes-acoustic-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=07fc64609e"},{"name":"Nico","tagline":"","description":"Isolated in an old and gloomy house, Tomaz and Martin spend their days in a tedious routine.

Much like Don Quijotes epic charge at a windmill that he believes to be a giant, the protagonist is attempting a challenge that a spectator would perceive as both inconsequential and potentially self destructive, since he is essentially shooting at himself. However, unlike Quijote, and unlike Tell, the protagonist is aware of this danger and protects himself from the ricocheting BBs with a suit of armor. The armor and the gun, which can be seen as past and present representations of masculine power, actually undermine his image as a heroic man by revealing his vulnerability. This is especially true in the case of the armor since its purpose is to protect him from his own inaccuracy.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/8/8/2/3/2/388232-william-tell-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=1d13df140a"},{"name":"Zone of Initial Dilution","tagline":"","description":"A study of the changing Chinese landscape around the Three Gorges Dam project, where the worlds biggest hydraulic dam is being constructed.
