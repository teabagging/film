Some expected Jesus to make the right political moves. We do not know the exact motivation behind Judas' betrayal but what is clear is that Judas allowed his desires to place him in a position where Satan could manipulate him.

In each of the texts, words common to the other language appear, creating an indeterminacy of the word to this or that speech. This indeterminacy is increased by the many word games created between the two languages. This results in a double reading: vertical and horizontal, favoured by the word for word. The exposure time of each word depends on the rhythmic of each language, but their appearance in white or black is not subject to it. Faced with these texts, two sounds intervene and otherwise disturb the concentration required by the projected texts. The horizontal reading of both speeches is often in clear contradiction with their meaning.

It is about a younger brother, Suekichi. He learned well the lessons that life taught his older brothers. Therefore, he does not think to study, but strives for material well-being alone. To make a career, he ruthlessly pushes his colleagues with his elbows.

What things are worth sacrificing your life for? Are moral second thoughts and the search for the truth stronger than man's endless search for instant pleasure?

On the one hand, the lines are reminiscent of the white markings on a street or a football field that guide traffic or play. On the other hand, the graphic pattern here has nothing to do with this reality; it exists in the wholly other and more abstract dimension of the framing of the image imposed by camera. Then the pattern of lines disappears, and the artist himself steps into the image. With the utmost concentration Dibbets follows the lines seen earlier, which were only notional in the physical space, having been determined by the eye of the camera. He crosses the field from the lower left to the upper right, and from he bottom to the top. He moves across the grass as carefully as a tightrope walker, now drawing the lines with his movements, like an invisible horizon.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/1/6/0/1/4/916014-vertical-horizontal-diagonal-square-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=e42d57346e"},{"name":"Fato?
