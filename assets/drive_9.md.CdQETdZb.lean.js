On his way to eclipsing Herschel Walkers record for the most touchdowns in high school history, Dupree attracted recruiters from schools in every major conference to his hometown of Philadelphia, Miss. More than a decade removed from being a flashpoint in the civil-rights struggle, Philadelphia was once again thrust back into the national spotlight. Dupree took the attention in stride, and committed to Oklahoma. What followed, though, was a forgettable college career littered with conflict, injury and oversized expectations. Eight-time Emmy Award winner Jonathan Hock will examine why this star burned out so young and how he ultimately used football to redeem himself.","rating":"3.67","theme":"Moving relationship stories","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/3/5/5/11355-the-best-that-never-was-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=cfac317506"},{"name":"Naan Mahaan Alla","tagline":"","description":"A playful young man leads a very happy life, but everything changes when his father witnesses a heinous crime.","rating":"3.34","theme":"Relationship comedy","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/4/8/0/0/14800-naan-mahaan-alla-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=3ac11ae1c7"},{"name":"Night Drive","tagline":"THE HUNTED BECOME THE HUNTERS","description":"A young couple working are out on a drive where they meet with an accident.

Interspliced between performance footage of Scott-Heron and his Midnight Band are vignettes of him walking around Washington D.C., spouting his views on then-President Reagan (dubbed \\"Ray-Gun\\") and generally dropping knowledge. The live performance features many of Scott-Heron's best-known hits, including \\"Johannesburg,\\" \\"Winter in America,\\" and \\"Angel Dust,\\" among others. Warm, intelligent, and insightful throughout, Scott-Heron is clearly enjoying himself and the opportunity to espouse his views. A must for any fan of Scott-Heron's, and definitely worth a look for fans of the funkier jazz music of the mid to late 1970's.","rating":"3.73","theme":"Crude humor and satire","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/7/1/9/2/7/171927-black-wax-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=bd92e537ee"},{"name":"The Movie Emperor","tagline":"","description":"In an attempt to win back the public's interest, has-been Hong Kong film star Lau Wai-chi makes a comeback film with a major director.
