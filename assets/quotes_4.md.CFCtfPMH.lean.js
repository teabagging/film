The expedition aimed to find traces of the so-called \\"lost villages\\", left by the Masurians around 1945 by the end of the Second World War. Today only some of the old graveyards can be found deep in the woods of the beautiful Masurian landscape.  The documentary \\"In the back of history - The lost villages of Masuria\\" shows the students at their work in the historic archives and in the woods. How conclusive can this kind of historic research be? How much can we really learn by looking through old files or other sources? And what can we learn from the vanishing of the Masurians? Do we face similar problems today?

As the year progresses, more and more issues surface dividing the younger and older residents: how much technology is acceptable? How much compromise is necessary and reasonable?

The leading young builder in America is Jesse James; he's a descendant of the famous outlaw and possesses the same renegade spirit. Jesse's lean and mean choppers have brought him worldwide attention and much deserved respect. For two weeks, Discovery Channel will take viewers behind the garage doors of Jesse's shop as he prepares several bikes that he hopes will be ready for unveiling at Bike Week in Daytona Beach, Fla. Over 600,000 bikers with scrutinizing eyes will be in attendance, serving as a major marketing event for Jesse and other builders. With so many bikes to finish, including his own, will Jesse make the deadline? Will the bikes be the masterpieces he seeks? The clock is ticking and Jesse has much to do!","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/3/1/9/8/53198-motorcycle-mania-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=9dbbc3b9f3"},{"name":"Belgi?-Turkije","tagline":"","description":"Lex doesn't have any ticket for the football match between Belgium and Turkey and out of superstition, refuses to watch it on television.

Acknowledging his failure, Vijay tenders his resignation and vows to bring Tantia back to jail so that he can complete his sentence. Vijay does find Tantia and readies himself to apprehend him, but he must first overcome an unexpected opponent, in the shape and form of Shankar, who is out to avenge the death of his sister, Pammi, at the hands of Tantia. Watch what happens when both Vijay and Shankar clash with each other for Tantia - while the bandit remains at large.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/6/0/1/3/1/860131-do-waqt-ki-roti-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=89a396eb40"},{"name":"Geheime Reichssache","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/6/5/1/6/2/1165162-geheime-reichssache-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=e3da79eec4"},{"name":"Yudda Bhoomi","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Swift Shadow","tagline":"","description":"Ye's father and son were greedy for millions of huge sums of money.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/2/4/2/4/1/724241-swift-shadow-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=a6ade9202a"},{"name":"Simon Peter Ninakku Vendi","tagline":"","description":"Simon Peter, a notorious smuggler who has fell in love with Alice and the struggles they have to face when Simon tried to cease all illegal activities forms the plot of the movie.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/5/4/2/4/5/554245-simon-peter-ninakku-vendi-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=7cc066816a"},{"name":"Bern Reithalle","tagline":"","description":"23.03.1988","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/9/7/5/5/8/797558-bern-reithalle-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=65911533e0"},{"name":"Ganam Courtar Avargale","tagline":"","description":"A 1988 Tamil Action Drama Film.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"ާӧڧ٧ѧڧ ߧ ֧ާ ҧڧԧѧڧ","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/0/6/5/3/3/806533---0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=b0cd1143b2"},{"name":"?","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/7/3/5/8/3/873583--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=5b0775bd92"},{"name":"Always Faster","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Beauty Queens: Helena Rubinstein","tagline":"","description":"Helena Rubinstein is rightly seen as one of the pioneers of a market worth millions - the female beauty market.
