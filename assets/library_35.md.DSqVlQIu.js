The work explores the ephemeral space between reality and mirage, and a physicality that recalls the dynamics of evaporating, condensing and falling water.

As she paints, Cita talks about her life in the Washington D.C. area, her cultural heritage, the influence of punk and hip-hop on her life and how she came to fall in love with graffiti in the 1980s when there were few women drawn to the culture at the time. Cita drew on her Javanese heritage to create a modern woman ornamented in traditional Indonesian jewelry yet rooted in 21st century youth culture. Filmmaker Sara T. Gama's aim was to elevate a womans voice from her community and visually tell her story, the result is a short documentary that unfolds Citas life as she creates her art, one color at a time.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/6/3/1/2/7/863127-miss-chelove-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=f6e2683b5c"},{"name":"Bocche inutili","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/8/5/6/0/3/685603-bocche-inutili-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=8ca448756d"},{"name":"Wild Child","tagline":"","description":"The Black Keys return to high school with a vengeance.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/2/0/5/5/8/1020558-wild-child-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=00ae35b1ea"},{"name":"My Brother Is Deaf","tagline":"","description":"A sweet five year-old learns that his younger brother is deaf and joins with his family in discovering how to embrace and support him.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/2/0/9/5/6/820956-my-brother-is-deaf-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=c21deee78a"},{"name":"Detective Dee and The Pact with the Underworld Gods","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/3/6/6/5/2/836652-detective-dee-and-the-pact-with-the-underworld-gods-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=0f2fdb5013"},{"name":"Irodorimidori","tagline":"","description":"Maigahara Music College Affiliate School Maigahara Senior High (abbreviated as MaiMai).
