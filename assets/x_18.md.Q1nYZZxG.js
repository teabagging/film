Moving across the town's earliest wooded beginning to its fiercely industrial urbanity, Austin, within the context of apathy and tragedy, is revealed through a rich interplay of narration, interviews, and detailed photographs. The film explores the social environment of Industrial America in the early 1900's with its rapidly shifting commercial interests, increasing immigration and severe tensions between factory owners and the working class. Turning on the tragic pivot of the flood, a portrait of an American community is etched starkly with the character of its people made plain in the receding waters.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Bathroom Crisis","tagline":"","description":"Hong Kong movie","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/7/5/2/5/5/1075255-bathroom-crisis-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=7e6c8a8a49"},{"name":"Berky, hraj!","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Blessed Fruit","tagline":"","description":"An irreverent nativity tale in which a woman seeks divine intervention when she thinks she is pregnant but is unsure who the father is.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Bliib uf em Teppich","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Cavalli Marci Show","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/0/7/4/1/3/207413-cavalli-marci-show-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=d287b0e4a1"},{"name":"Charsho","tagline":"","description":"In a small village in the Iranian countryside, a young womans marriage leads to both partying and partaking.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Chiemgauer Volkstheater - Der blaue Heinrich","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Chiemgauer Volkstheater - Die Millionenoma","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Christa Ludwig: The Birthday Edition","tagline":"","description":"Internationally recognized German mezzo-soprano Christa Ludwig performs songs by Franz Schubert, Hugo Wolf, Gustav Mahler, Richard Strauss, and Leonard Bernstein.

Neutral Switzerland, which hadnt experienced a war since the 14th century, hurriedly fortified its borders with battalions of inexperienced soldiers. The panic, confusion and isolated acts of courage which occurred on that fateful day are re-created in this Swiss docudrama. The story is personalized by concentrating on a fugitive German soldier (Heinz Reincke) who falls in love with the Swiss girl (Linda Geiser) who shelters him. Produced on a bare-minimum budget, Der 10.

The policy forced cotton cultivation in the southern region of the Korean Peninsula and sheep raising in the north in order to secure raw materials for its own industry. The film chronicles the process of transporting thousands of sheep on a boat from Australia to the Unggi region (now Seonbong in North Korea), how the sheep adapt after their arrival, and the process of wool production. The narration of the film, which appears as intertitles, is from the sheep's point of view, giving the film a whimsical, childrens-movie-like touch. Although the film hides its purpose of explicit propaganda behind its family-friendly format, it is of great importance; it gives us a glimpse into one aspect of the policy of expropriation of cotton and sheep under the Japanese colonial rule in the 1930s.

We can enjoy magnificent engines including some of the Castle and King Class that were turned out at Swindon. These include the 4079 Pendennis Castle, 5029 Nunney Castle, 7020 Gloucester Castle, 6000 King George V, 6024 King Edward I and others that have since ended up at the cutters. We also see engines that have been used on these lines of late including the Eurostar, Intercity 125s, the high speed trains on the Heathrow Express Service, ARC stone trains as well as single, two-and three-car units. And our look at the GWR wouldn t be complete without a visit to preserved lines including the Taff Valley Railway and the Cholsey and Wallingford Railway.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/6/4/4/7/5/864475-britain-s-railways-then-now-gwr-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=32fd5e0b50"},{"name":"Britannicus","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Brit Floyd - Space and Time World Tour '15","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/2/9/1/9/8/529198-brit-floyd-space-and-time-world-tour-15-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=0f0cb0ccf6"},{"name":"Bronx-Barbs","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Brother and Sister in the Snow","tagline":"","description":"Brother and sister playing in the snow.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Bruckner: Symphony No. 1","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/5/8/7/1/9/858719-bruckner-symphony-no1-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=182dc078c6"},{"name":"Bruckner: Symphony No. 2","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/5/8/7/3/5/858735-bruckner-symphony-no-2-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=70804d93bb"},{"name":"Bruckner: Symphony No. 3","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/5/8/7/1/7/858717-bruckner-symphony-no-3-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=3bd7f37dc8"},{"name":"Bruckner: Symphony No. 5","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/5/8/7/1/6/858716-bruckner-symphony-no-5-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=fae97fb8e7"},{"name":"Bruckner: Symphony No. 6","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/5/8/7/1/3/858713-bruckner-symphony-no-6-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=94a20fdc96"},{"name":"Bruckner: Symphony No. 8","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/5/8/7/1/4/858714-bruckner-symphony-no-8-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=9a43ebf756"},{"name":"Bruckner: Symphony No. 9","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/5/8/7/3/4/858734-bruckner-symphony-no-9-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=9c6d1f596f"},{"name":"Brujo","tagline":"","description":"Brujo is an exploration of shamanism and curing among the Mazatec Indians of Oaxaca, Mexico, and among two groups of Maya Indians in southern Mexico and Guatemala. The film is divided into three sequences. The first, filmed in Chichicastenango (Guatemala), shows Diego, a shaman, cure a woman on whom a spell has been cast. The cure takes place partly in a church and partly in the mountains, where a sacrificed chicken is used to bring back the ailing woman's spirit. The second sequence moves to Oaxaca, where a Mazatec shaman, her husband, and her patient consume hallucinogenic mushrooms. The cure, which takes place in darkness, involves a simple song (the mushroom's \\"voice\\") and dance, flowers, and the rubbing of tobacco on both the patient and the shaman's husband. The final sequence takes place in the Chiapas highlands of Mexico, site of the festival and film Tajimoltik. The filmmakers encounter shaman Miguel, who brings them to his family home in a mountain hamlet beyond Chenalho.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Brum og Motocross Mesteren","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Brunotti Kiteboarding Brasil","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/7/7/7/3/117773-brunotti-kiteboarding-brasil-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=6f6c17e1f9"},{"name":"Brute Force and Finesse","tagline":"","description":"From the frontiers of technology, a look at new ways of shaping and forming materials.
