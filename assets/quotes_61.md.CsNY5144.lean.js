A champion of creative imagination, Ross was also an original interpreter of depth psychology in the context of his knowledge of world literature and religions. His generosity as a mentor, and his artistry as a lecturer on the poetry of Blake, Shelley and the Romantics made him unforgettable, life changing. He played a key role in the 'Regionalist' art scene in London, Ontario in the 1960s which gave us many of Canada's most significant artists. Ross accompanied Marion through her journey as a pioneering Jungian analyst who brought the Feminine into depth psychology. Through the prism of Woodman's troubled life, the film maker explores the dynamic among, love, creativity and madness in movies, poetry and art.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/1/9/6/9/0/1119690-rebel-angel-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=72e27c6d15"},{"name":"Schneewittchen - Der Usedom-Krimi","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/6/7/9/5/3/1067953-schneewittchen-der-usedom-krimi-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=e2cc573457"},{"name":"Az MSZP Halltusja","tagline":"","description":"Until the mid 2000s, Tiszavri was one of MSZP's most important bases, but then a sharp change occurred in the city's and the electoral district's history, so much so that after 2010 it became known as Jobbik's capital city.

However, on 27 February 2020, the Turkish government encouraged and mobilized thousands of migrants and refugees to cross into Greece at the Evros/Meri? region in order to exert political pressure on the EU to comply with Turkish interest in Syria. On 2 March, after several days of tension, violence escalated at the border. Reports emerged of shootings, and a casualty near the river delta. The victim was identified as Muhammad al Arab, a young man from Aleppo, Syria. We established that rounds were fired along that stretch of the border on that day and Muhammad al-Arab was killed in Turkish soil within 15-135m from a group of armed Greek soldiers standing right on the border. Our analysis supports the testimony of several witnesses who claim that al-Arab was shot by this group of Greek soldiers. -FA","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/2/3/9/2/4/1123924-the-killing-of-muhammad-al-arab-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=4ca1b43939"},{"name":"The Lost Jade Unicorn","tagline":"","description":"In search for jade unicorn Zhan Chao lost the unicorn's magical energy to the modern city, and encountered many unexpected stories in the process","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/7/6/4/2/4/676424-the-lost-jade-unicorn-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=05d38f9e99"},{"name":"Sometimes It Felt So Real: A Collaborative Dance Film","tagline":"","description":"In this short musical film, four women use movement and dance to express the extraordinary in their ordinary lives.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/4/4/8/8/9/644889-sometimes-it-felt-so-real-a-collaborative-dance-film-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=0cb035100f"},{"name":"The End of Days","tagline":"","description":"Al struggles to connect with his friends and his life after a stay in a mental institution.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/4/2/6/2/3/642623-the-end-of-days-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=857915ce04"},{"name":"To Hayeon","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Sett El Donia","tagline":"A letter to Beirut, a city like no other.","description":"A letter to Beirut, a city like no other.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/5/9/8/4/2/1059842-sett-el-donia-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=704536d7d0"},{"name":"Hold On","tagline":"","description":"The film explores dance as a form of protest, a cathartic release, and a peaceful form of assembly during the Black Lives Matter movement.

The film moves in the free-flowing memory tracks of a small indigenous people and tries to create a common memory image of the past 100 years from the diversity of the protagonists. The focus of the film narrative is the Russian territory of their homeland \\"Lapland\\", which is now divided between four countries.  Grandmother of Zoya Mikhailovna was born in Finnish territory.  In 1937, this was sufficient reason to upset the father of the little Zoya. Together with Zoya 18 Sami people of Kola Peninsula recall their past life memories in film.  The past and the present flow into each other. However, you can feel a huge gap between \\"today\\" and \\"yesterday\\".","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/6/6/8/6/7/966867-habitat-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=4b08d266d8"},{"name":"Hi, My Name is Lilliana","tagline":"","description":"Filmmaker and animator Lilliana Rice explores the complicated identity of being a mixed native.
