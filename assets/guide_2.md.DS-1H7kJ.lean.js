If the film feels somehow familiar yet you can't put your finger on the reason why, it's probably the sumptuously minimalist animation by Yasuhiro Nagura, who was the animation director of Mamoru Oshii's artsy 1986 feature Angel's Egg. That, and Kenji's wildcat is said to have been the inspiration for Miyazaki's Panda/Totoro creature. The idea of reading Kenji's story aloud instead of playing it out as a drama is quite refreshing, and Kenji's magical language and narrative style are entirely sufficient to sustain interest. Combined with the spacey music and breathtaking art, the result is a pleasantly unassuming little gem of a film.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/5/2/0/1/1/452011-the-acorns-and-the-wildcat-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=ca3c3b80bf"},{"name":"American Taboo","tagline":"","description":"Paul, a shy photographer of 30 years, avoids relationships in favor of the safety landscape photography.

The story is certainly fleshed out quite a bit more and the final 15 minutes of the film comprise a surprisingly powerful conclusion (worth the price of admission on its own), but I would have liked a more original story rather then a highly polished version of one that I've already enjoyed. In the end, spectacular visuals, great new music, and well thought out additions to the core story leave you feeling glad to have seen the film.

Starting with Funk's roots in Jazz and the James Brown bands of the '60s we travel to the Bay Area to celebrate Sly & the Family Stone, then to Dayton the birthplace of so many of Funk's originators, then onto Detroit where from the ashes of Motown, P-Funk's Mothership arose, and then to LA where a new crop of musicians are creating their own Funk history. On our journey into Funk, we talk to legends Sly Stone, Bootsy Collins, George Clinton, Nona Hendryx, Maceo Parker, Bernie Worrell, and Steve Arrington and their descendants Mike D, D'Angelo, Sheila E, Shock G and Sade's Stuart Matthewman. Narrated by Ahmir 'Questlove' Thompson of the Roots.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/2/9/9/2/5/129925-finding-the-funk-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=dadd8b1f7e"},{"name":"The Inner Jungle","tagline":"","description":"Before embarking on a long scientific expedition to the Pacific, Juan takes his girlfriend Gala to the town where he spent his childhood.

The soundtrack, recorded by Duane Hitchings (known for his collaborations with Miles Davis and Hendrix, but also for his Flashdance OST) on a Moog synth, is an engaging exercise in abstract sonic dynamics and an essential part of the Doppler experiment in that it not only provides different aural settings for the diverse footage presented throughout the film, but also aptly sets the pace for the fast succession of synched images.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/8/3/0/0/2/383002-doppler-effect-version-ii-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=bb527b2efd"},{"name":"How We Stole the Atomic Bomb","tagline":"","description":"Franco, an Italian fisherman, witnesses a U.S. Air Force plane crash in the Mediterranean off Egypt carrying a nuclear weapon, and he is then persued by shady spy, named Ciccio, working for a spy organization led by the sinister Dr. Si (Yes) to find the atom bomb before anyone else does to blackmail the world, which leads to Franco and Ciccio forming an unlikely alliance to get the bomb for themselves.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/6/4/2/6/86426-how-we-stole-the-atomic-bomb-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=04201e00e4"},{"name":"The Denunciation","tagline":"","description":"Michel Jussieu, a film producer, returns one morning to the cabaret where he forgot his sweater.

While Gance was shooting Napoleon in 1925-26, he and his crew were also being filmed for a documentary titled Autour de Napoleon. The only extant reels from that documentary are included in this film, as well as views of Gance's unique \\"triptychs\\" -- three different scenes lined up side-by-side across a super-wide screen to convey the effect of a panorama, or of three separate interludes. Nelly Kaplan put together this documentary using old footage, such as Gance filming the famous snowball fight at the Brienne military school and still photographs and excerpts from Gance's production diaries.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/2/4/5/3/8/324538-abel-gance-et-son-napoleon-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=a1186215cd"},{"name":"Melanie","tagline":"She had to fight for what most women take for granted","description":"A backwoods, illiterate young woman from Arkansas battles to regain custody of her son from her estranged husband who feels she is an unfit mother.
