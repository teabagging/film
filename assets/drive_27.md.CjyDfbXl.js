The short is a brief account of Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis and his discovery of the need for cleanliness in 19th-century maternity wards, thereby significantly decreasing maternal mortality, and of his struggle to gain acceptance of his idea. Although Semmelweis ultimately failed in his lifetime, later scientific luminaries advanced his work in spirit like microbiologist Louis Pasteur, who provided a scientific theoretical explanation of Semmelweis' observations by helping develop the germ theory of disease and the British surgeon, Dr. Joseph Lister who revolutionized medicine putting Pasteur's research to practical use. In 1939, at the 11th Academy Awards, the film won an Oscar for Best Short Subject (One-Reel).","rating":"","theme":"Funny jokes and crude humor","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/6/5/3/7/5/165375-that-mothers-might-live-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=4e94b15fe8"},{"name":"Comic 8: Casino Kings - Part 2","tagline":"","description":"Eight secret agents assigned to go undercover as stand up comedians in search of a comedian who becomes a liaison to the master criminal named The King, the most spectacular gambling casino owner in Asia.","rating":"2.92","theme":"Gags, jokes, and slapstick humor","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/1/6/2/1/3/316213-comic-8-casino-kings-part-2-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=4959750d27"},{"name":"Death Note: The Musical","tagline":"","description":"A high school student who comes across a supernatural notebook, realizing it holds within it a great power; if the owner inscribes someones name into it while picturing their face, he or she will die.","rating":"3.63","theme":"Amusing jokes and witty satire","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/3/1/7/7/4/731774-death-note-the-musical-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=8fcf273308"},{"name":"The Double Lottie","tagline":"","description":"A young, inquisitive girl named Nargess encounters a girl from another school who could pass as her twin.

The film offers a close-up view of a wide range of creatures such as the insect that appears out of the melting snow, gradually begins to move and impatiently waits until all its legs are free so it can fly away.
