Khadijah tells the story of why she always wears a suit and tie while Pauline listens on, touched. The next year, in June, the couple has an argument after attending an uncomfortable party and this threatens the future of their relationship. Later that year, they reconvene at a cafe to take stock of where they stand. Each segment is characterized by a story told by either Khadijah or Pauline that paints a vivid picture of their background and personal struggles. The complex and poignant tale becomes less about love and more about the stories we tell to explain and illuminate ourselves.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/2/0/6/6/8/620668-one-year-of-khadijah-and-pauline-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=2e981726cf"},{"name":"Covideodrone","tagline":"","description":"A collective drone composed by Montral artists during the COVID 19 confinement set to a film by Philippe Lonard.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/4/7/5/5/1/647551-covideodrone-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=f1ad9e72c1"},{"name":"The Circle","tagline":"It Can't End","description":"A young man is viciously attacked in his own home, but soon learns an awful truth about his attacker.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/0/2/0/9/2/702092-the-circle-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=a9ba9cd6d8"},{"name":"Spore","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/1/3/9/2/9/613929-spore-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=aa795aa240"},{"name":"Le Rond-Point de la colre","tagline":"","description":"The roundabout in Aimargues is one of the first emblematic places of the Yellow Vests movement, the symbol of an outlier France.
