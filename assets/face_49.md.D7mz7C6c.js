But this precious resource, once thought to be inexhaustible, is under threat. Forest Alert breaks through the silence and ignorance surrounding current forestry practices and questions our collective responsibility for the destruction of Quebec's rich timberlands. The script is typical of acclaimed Quebec singer/songwriter Richard Desjardins: strong words, striking imagery, paradoxes that challenge how our forests are managed. Opinions are firmly held and diametrically opposed. There are those who cherish this precious legacy and are worried about our exploitation of it. There are those, in government and industry, who swear that the forest will be preserved for future generations. Citing the concerns of professional foresters, the film is a direct attack on the depredation of what should be a sustainable resource.

The film represents an adventure in the forest of the black storks. The concealed life of these birds has never before been documented in such detail. Unique footage recorded in state-of-the-art HD technology complete with elaborate sound-editing, creates a real nature experience which is a pleasure for both the eyes and the ears.

The stage director is Michael Hampe, who was behind the similarly excellent Schwetzingen Agrippina from 1985, also released on a EuroArts DVD (2054538). Hampe makes no attempt to put a miniature Persia on the stage of Dresden's Semperoper, nor does he imitate what Serse might have looked like in 1738. Instead, this is a fantasy Persia as it might have been imagined by 18th-century Europeans, but as it could have been realized only through modern stagecraft. The costuming is handsome, and the splendid sets are fluid and adaptable. As in his Agrippina, Hampe doesn't shortchange the opera's potential for comedy, but he shows restraint and resists the temptation to yuck it up or make it silly.

The giant grizzly bear in the film was portrayed by a bear named Teddy, who was 11 feet tall. A sequel, Grizzly II: The Concert, was filmed in 1983 in Hungary by director Andr Sz?ts, but was never released to theaters. Sheldon, the co-producer and writer of Grizzly, wrote the screenplay with his screenwriter wife, McCall, who also reprised her role from the original film. The stars were Louise Fletcher, Steve Inwood, John Rhys-Davies, Deborah Raffin and Deborah Foreman; the cast also included Charlie Sheen, George Clooney and Laura Dern, who were unknown at the time.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"GrowJust","tagline":"Secure your Growth","description":"GrowJust is an Indian security services company.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Grup Gerak Khas The Movie","tagline":"","description":"Plot unknown","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Grus","tagline":"","description":"The main character Burakhan Isakhaev is a film director.
