Her best friend Jessie McLachlan was subsequently arrested and accused of murder. There was a public outcry however, when it became evident that McLachlan's wealthy employers were being protected by the authorities. Jessie McLachlan always denied the murder, and maintained that James Fleming had attacked McPherson in a fit of drunken rage, but despite much evidence against Fleming, a jury found McLachlan guilty and she was sentenced to hang. Despite widespread public sympathy, she went on to serve fifteen years in prison after the sentence was commuted.

It was faster than a battleship, and had firepower far beyond other ships of this size.  It was responsible for the sinking of as many as nine Allied merchant vessels in the autumn of 1939 in the space of three months. Then, late in the year, the ship was ambushed off the coast of Uruguay by British cruisers determined to sink her. Faced with insurmountable odds, the ship's captain, Hans Langsdorff, opted to destroy his own vessel rather than capitulate to the enemy. Hitler's Lost Battleship retraces the events leading up to the ship's destruction.  With high-end re-enactments, CGI reconstructions, and surprising revelations from naval researchers - all add up to shed new light on this fascinating episode in wartime history.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/7/2/6/7/6/272676-hitler-s-lost-battleship-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=636bef2ea6"},{"name":"It Came From Yesterday","tagline":"If you think you know adventure, you don't know JACK...","description":"IT CAME FROM YESTERDAY launches scientist/adventurer Professor Jack into unknown realms of adventure!

This CD and DVD, recorded at Capitol Studios in Los Angeles, is Cachao's fourth collaboration with Garcia. The ageless bandleader's deep arco and pizzicato basslines anchor an all-star group, which includes salsa trombonist Jimmy Bosch, timbalero Orestes Vilato, and tresguitarist Neslon Gonzalez. They lay down the Afro-Cuban rhythms that range from the changui to the rumba. \\"Mambo Cambio de Swing\\" links Havana to Harlem, while \\"Guajira Clasica\\" marries Bartokian style with the Cuban countryside. \\"Queja Africana/Protesta Abakua\\" is laced with Justo Almario's Coltrane-tinged saxophone and completes the transcultural influences of this great musician.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/5/4/1/0/0/254100-cachao-ahora-si--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=797206afd4"},{"name":"Inside","tagline":"","description":"A short horror film","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Paul McCartney Live in Madrid","tagline":"","description":"Concert at The Stadium disappeared comb.

It's a necessary compensation for the shortcomings of the staging: the stolid chorus remains unperturbed by the storm and is directed to perform with unison movements; the acting (apart from Valeri Alexejev) is non-committal, and Alexandre Tarta's video direction somewhat flat-footed.

Nearly every shot contains Asmahan (she is the only actor in the film who appears to be talking), which is meant to create an obsessive relationship with the image reminding us of the interplay of voyeurism and exhibitionism that makes the actor that we see on the screen dream like, especially when she also sees us. This dream logic suggests that there is a hidden life, which exists through pictures, lurking in even the most superficial and trite of B-films.
