Narrative is subverted as the kissing is isolated from its context entirely; the action slows down and flickers back and forth. Every now and then, shots from different films overlap and match; protagonists merge and diverge again a few seconds later.

Hamar women eagerly accept their ritual whipping when boys come of age.  Part of that tradition was the open, even flamboyant, observance of male supremacy. In their isolation, they seemed to have refined this not uncommon principle of social organization into a remarkably pure state. Hamar men are masters and their women are slaves.

This excellent tome contains close analysis by Bruce Jenkins of film-school staples like A Movie and Looking For Mushrooms as well as of later works like Valse Triste and Take the 5:10 to Dreamland. The 1969 film is called Permian Strata, a title which works in conjunction with the images and the song that makes up the film's soundtrack to form a colossal pun. So often experimental film gets pigeonholed as overly serious, boring, stuffy, or requiring an expertise in filmmaking processes to fully appreciate.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/7/3/2/3/9/273239-permian-strata-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=81157d5f40"},{"name":"Put-Put, Pink","tagline":"","description":"The Pink Panther turns his hand to building a motorcycle, but mayhem ensues whenever he goes for a drive.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/1/4/4/3/7/314437-put-put-pink-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=0988c3e2e4"},{"name":"From Generation to Generation","tagline":"","description":"This film illustrates the basic facts of human reproduction shown through the lives of a young farm couple with one child.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/2/5/5/2/112552-from-generation-to-generation-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=58be5bbd95"},{"name":"Tinsel Tree","tagline":"","description":"Made when Anger was only 14 years old, Tinsel Tree is a short that demonstrated his early disdain for the Christmas season. Anger shows the Christmas tree as it is decorated in a series of close-ups, then the post-Christmas tree is shown burning in a garbage can colored in a burst of hand-painted gold flame. Although circulated on 16 mm through 1967, Anger then withdrew Tinsel Tree. It is possible that the film no longer exists, but it may be among a few extant titles that Anger has stated he prefers not to show. From written descriptions, the connectivity of this very-short short to Kenneth Anger's later work is obvious.
