Volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and tsunamis form the films visual fabric, and are set against images of grandiose natural landscapes. A visual elegy, the film resolutely acknowledges the superiority of nature, with its unrelenting force, capable of transcending all human ambition. With this, the filmmaker seems to remind us that humankind will not emerge victorious from the ecological havoc that it has created.","rating":"3.52","theme":"Political drama, patriotism, and war","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/7/6/0/4/7/676047-nature-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=4a5f4afe3d"},{"name":"Lazarus","tagline":"Look up here, I'm in heaven","description":"Inspired by the book, The Man Who Fell To Earth, Lazarus focuses on Thomas Newton, as he remains still on Earth - a 'man' unable to die, his head soaked in cheap gin and haunted by a past love.

The viewer watches the film, by standing with his, or her, back towards what would normally be the screen, and looking along the beam towards the projector itself. The film begins as a coherent line of light, like a laser beam, and develops through the 30 minute duration, into a complete, hollow cone of light.
