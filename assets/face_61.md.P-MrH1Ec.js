The military component of the Slovak State are allies of the Nazis, and with them came on Polish territory. They're alongside the mighty army of Hitler's occupation force. In the decimated Polish town the Commander of the Slovak company Major Valenta issues orders that all residents surrender weapons if they own any. Insubordination will be punishable by death. Shortly after, the charming young Polish lady ?ofie reports Valenta about: Professor Klosowski, who is Professor of Botany at the local high school, said to be hiding out at home in the library of the gun. Valenta reluctantly executes search warrant and weapon is found, but it is immediately clear that the old Professor became the victim of misunderstandings or possible fraud. To his surprise, he soon discovers that Sophie has a close relationship with Klosowski. But just before he fathoms the mystery, the occupation machinery executes havoc.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/7/9/6/5/3/379653-dama-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=e285adebca"},{"name":"Il ragazzo di Gigliola","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/4/0/8/6/8/840868-il-ragazzo-di-gigliola-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=c02214690c"},{"name":"A metafsica dos chocolates","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/9/1/0/0/2/1091002-a-metafisica-dos-chocolates-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=d884f8186d"},{"name":"Sentinel: The West Face","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/4/8/1/0/8/948108-sentinel-the-west-face-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=5b5a84e336"},{"name":"Vincent van Go-Go","tagline":"","description":"An impressionist-anchored, pop art-driven, surrealist animation about war fears, industrial overdevelopment, and many other civilisational neuroses.

Unlike a 3D zoetrope, which animates a sequence of small changes to objects, a bloom animates as a single self-contained sculpture. The blooms animation effect is achieved by progressive rotations of the golden ratio, phi (?), the same ratio that nature employs to generate the spiral patterns we see in pinecones and sunflowers. The rotational speed and strobe rate of the bloom are synchronized so that one flash occurs every time the bloom turns 137.5o (the angular version of phi).* Each blooms particular form and behavior is determined by a unique parametric seed I call a phi-nome (/f nm/)","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/0/7/3/5/0/807350-blooms-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=f2b3b9ee82"},{"name":"Body of Ashes","tagline":"","description":"A crematory employee uncovers a conspiracy about unmarked bodies getting turned to ash but quickly finds himself escaping that same fate.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/2/7/4/6/5/827465-body-of-ashes-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=a252f6de77"},{"name":"The Boozangler","tagline":"He Boos and he Zangles","description":"Beth and Mia are just going about their days when they suddenly get boozangled...","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/5/0/1/5/5/1050155-the-boozangler-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=747ad51fbe"},{"name":"Britain's Forgotten Serial Killer","tagline":"","description":"Known as the \\"Beast of Manchester,\\" Trevor Hardy committed a series of horrific murders in the 1970s, but the reasons why have remained unknown.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Broken Glass on a Pinhole Body","tagline":"Broken glass on a pinhole body","description":"H wants to connect sexually with Y.

Four decades later they have returned to Ireland with a huge archive of photographs to find the people they once knew to learn what has happened in their lives in the intervening years. When the Gmelch's first came to Ireland in 1970 accommodation for travelers was a big issue. They were young anthropology students looking for an area of Irish culture to study. They became interested in travelers and soon they were living among them in order to study their culture close up. They carried out some of the first academic research into travelers and published a number of books including 'The Urbanisation of an Itinerant People', 'Tinkers and Travellers' and 'Nan-The Life of an Irish Travelling Woman'.

Clad in faded denim and a checked shirt, he sold 30 million records and became a charismatic icon of Irish music, inspiring musicians such as Brian May, The Edge, Slash and Johnny Marr.  But away from the stage, Rory was an intensely private man. His closest confidante was his brother Dnal who accompanied Rory on his rise from their childhood Everly Brothers stage performances and the Showband scene across the North and South of the Irish border through to the deafening heart of the 70s rock scene in London C and far beyond. Now, Dnal, along with insights from Rorys friends and admirers, takes us on a musical journey through the life and career of this shy guitar hero to better understand what made him so great.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/8/4/8/7/5/1184875-rory-gallagher-calling-card-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=58a1af5f81"},{"name":"Kaburagi","tagline":"","description":"Kaburaki, a photographer for a weekly magazine, exposes a scandal that drives an actress to her death.
