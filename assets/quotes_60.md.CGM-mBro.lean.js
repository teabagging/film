As she navigates through the gut-wrenching chronology of his enlistment on the eve of 9/11, his traumatizing experiences in combat, and his futile attempts at readjustment after returning home, the narrative unravels to reveal the silent and insidious toll of war on the mental health of soldiers. Compelled by her son's devastating suicide, Velda transforms her grief into a call for action, articulating her concerns about the military's approach to mental health issues in a letter to the president.

He is drawn to the spiritual qualities in the artworks and utilitarian objects of other cultures, specifically Oceanic, African, and Native American, an ethnographic interest he combines with an accumulation of personal experience to inform much of his long career. Though his sculpture draws deeply from these various sources, Murrell pushes his form beyond the referent to become something completely new - so new that certain pieces feel like discoveries rather than constructions. With over 200 exhibitions of his work, Murrell has chosen to retain most of it so that it can be displayed to the public in a former cotton mill in the north Georgia foothills.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/4/7/8/7/5/847875-micheal-murrel-art-nature-and-catawampus-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=2afc1e458d"},{"name":"Raijingu Jakuchu","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/4/3/8/6/5/1043865-raijingu-jakuchu-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=97d14132ce"},{"name":"Angler","tagline":"","description":"A surgeon takes a fishing trip after an accident in the operating room.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/7/6/2/9/7/976297-angler-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=9e3fbbf1cc"},{"name":"Dream","tagline":"","description":"Official music video by DOC Native (Seminole Tribe of Florida) and Spencer Battiest (Seminole Tribe of Florida) performing the single Dream.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/0/4/4/6/0/804460-dream-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=92e4687a13"},{"name":"Escondidas","tagline":"","description":"Juan and Luca play hide and seek in the forest.
