Wilson concludes his journey by visiting some of the key locations around which the poet structured his final masterpiece, Four Quartets. Eliot's poetry is widely regarded as complex and difficult; it takes on weighty ideas of time, memory, faith and belief, themes which Wilson argues have as much relevance today as during the poet's lifetime. And whilst hailing his genius, Wilson does not shy away from confronting the discomforting and dark side of his work - the poems now widely regarded as anti-Semitic.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"R?hrenglockengeister","tagline":"","description":"It's witching hour and Mother Spirit wakes her children, who are sleeping in the tubular bells.

Like all legends of lost civilisations, their stories have captivated explorers throughout time who have searched in vain for the mysterious land in the Pacific, drawing the conclusion that the Easter Island natives were telling tall tales. Now, however, the sceptics might have to eat their words. New scientific evidence points to a remote island chain in Polynesia, suggesting it was the centre of an ancient and thriving civilisation. For 400 years, they have been known as the Marquesas Archipelago, but before they were simply called the Isles of Hiva. This documentary combines archaeological and geological evidence with tales passed down through generations, uncovering a dramatic history of cannibals, vast stone cities, human sacrifice, and the epic voyagers who colonised the Pacific centuries before Columbus made it to America.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/0/7/1/5/90715-lost-world-of-the-pacific-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=3fee14462e"},{"name":"Parsifal","tagline":"","description":"Parsifal in Bayreuth, directed by Stefan Herheim and conducted by Daniele Gatti.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/0/8/6/4/3/1008643-parsifal-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=afeab0ed71"},{"name":"2CELLOS - Live at iTunes Festival 2011","tagline":"","description":"Setlist:  1.

Scams, robbery and even murder went un-investigated.  After all, the Osages did nothing to earn their riches.  The silence of decades has done little to relieve the suspicion and enmity between the Osage and their white neighbors.  No one talks about it; or even acknowledges that it happened.

A local leader called Koriam founded the Pomio Kivung Movement in 1964.
