It is a conventional melodrama directed by Oscar Micheaux.[1] Like many of Micheaux's films, Deceit casts clerics in a negative light.[2] Although the film was shot in 1921, it was not released until 1923.[3] It is not known whether the film currently survives,[4] which suggests that it is a lost film.  The 1922 film The Hypocrite was shown within Deceit as a film within a film.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"I Am Caipora","tagline":"","description":"The animation tells the story of Luana, a girl who is passionate about animals and lives in the countryside of S?o Paulo.

Guy died in his early 30s in 1978 of a heart attack during an operation on his infected teeth. His tooth decay had been caused by the fact that visitors were allowed to feed him sweets. Famously, in 2018, a fake excerpt from Michael Wolffs biography claimed that White House staffers created a Gorilla channel for Donald Trump to watch.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"I.C.E.
