As brightly colored images of authority figures blend into scenes of cocktail parties, this 21-minute silent film flows along with the grace of a musical score built on complex tensions hidden among the notes. \\"Whose authority will you obey?\\" the film seems to ask, as it deftly avoids simple-minded juxtapositions. Instead, we see a melange of images so full of geography (Notre Dame Cathedral, the Sydney Opera House, Fifth Avenue), that the work mocks the idea of any specific setting.  -- Caryn James, The New York Times.

The motifs and colors of his canvasses have been widely reproduced, and are now part of the 20th century art pantheon, changing the way we view the world. Hockney is typically seen as an artist who loves life, a good time, glamour and sex. The highly personal and emotional side of his work is often overlooked, much like the intensity and individuality he has shown in each of his successive periods and styles. Through images, anecdotes, and detailed pictorial analysis, this documentary highlights how the renowned painter defies classification and remains mysterious in many ways: an intense, profound, and infinitely passionate artist.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/9/9/5/2/5/599525-david-hockney-die-wiedergefundene-zeit-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=931b08772a"},{"name":"I'm Sorry, I Love You","tagline":"","description":"Ritsu was abandoned by his mother Reiko when he was little, so now he belongs in the lower social strata.
