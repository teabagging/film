Only a closing text panel dedicating the film to the murdered teachers of El Salvador establishes a clear political context. LA ZONA INTERTIDAL was shown at the Short Film Festival Oberhausen in 1982 and awarded one of the main prizes by the International Jury.

As Ramos, a compelling raconteur, tells the story of his interactions with prisoners and guards as a 23-year-old draft resister, his charged performance narrative is interrupted with vintage cartoons that feature grotesque racial stereotypes. Ramos' stories of prison life are overlaid with footage from the artist's early performances and his 1977 video About Media, which addressed the media's coverage of President Carter's amnesty for draft resisters. The result is an extraordinary first-hand narrative of Ramos' prison experiences within the cultural, racial and political climate of America in the late 1960s.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/1/8/9/8/9/618989-decent-men-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=4da8c49652"},{"name":"Nikudyshko","tagline":"","description":"In the middle of summer, suddenly winter came.

For anyone who has ever been left wanting after seeing one of their tricks on David Letterman's show, this is an overflowing bounty. Duo's signature is a constant state of misdirection, flubbing one or more aspects of a trick --- even to the apparent point of death or mutilation --- to make the finale that much more spectacular. They even explain tricks: one with cards so anyone can do it at home and another with cups and balls that, rather than explicate, is an astonishing display of technique. Throughout, Penn combines carnival barking with political soapbox ranting --- subversive, sublime and wildly amusing --- and bolsters the weirdness factor of even the most ordinary trick.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/1/1/4/2/6/411426-home-invasion-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=21e5d26d37"},{"name":"Germans","tagline":"","description":"A story about a German family during World War II with every family member having a different approach to Jews, raging from hatred to compassion.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/7/4/4/6/6/374466-germans-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=1899469531"},{"name":"Shura ga Yuku 4","tagline":"","description":"The fourth of the extreme actions that depicts the men who are confronting the war set by the Kansai yakuza who are planning to advance to the Kanto region by taking advantage of the off-track betting dispute.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/4/2/8/6/8/842868-shura-ga-yuku-4-great-tokyo-war-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=2ce0643977"},{"name":"Olivier Messiaen: The Crystal Liturgy","tagline":"","description":"A portrait of French composer Olivier Messiaen (1908C1992), through archival films from 1964 to 1987.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/0/7/2/2/2/507222-olivier-messiaen-the-crystal-liturgy-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=7a226433e3"},{"name":"Salaryman Senka: Tanshin Funin","tagline":"","description":"Based on the long running manga of the same name by Sadao Shouji.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/5/6/2/7/8/456278-salaryman-senka-tanshinfunin-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=ff12681eee"},{"name":"Flowers of the Forest","tagline":"","description":"Two young children are brought to Janet Hinton, a social worker in the Scottish Highlands.

Actively at work in his studio on several large collages, one can clearly see Dine's masterful balance of artistic freedom and control, as he adds and modifies illusionistic images, written words and real life objects to his compositions. The artist talks about his connections to literature and about his frequent collaboration with poets; he also discusses his own poetry, some of which he reads for the camera. The parks and streets of London are the setting for Dine's frank comments about his voluntary exile in that city. On one walk, Dine encounters Gilbert and George as they endlessly repeat \\"Underneath the Arches\\" in bronze make-up, their earliest performance piece.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/2/4/9/8/4/224984-jim-dine-london-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=14d567e603"},{"name":"Goodbye, I'm Kurt","tagline":"","description":"A  story of 6-year-old Alberte who decides to leave her parents, because they are always busy working or watching TV, and dont have time to do fun things with her.
