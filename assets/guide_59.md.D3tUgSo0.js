The DOC association, which is supposed to look after the interest of independent vintners, promotes winemakers who produce vast amounts in a standardised quality; and the agricultural industry with its hygiene regulations excludes traditional methods of production. The only thing saving the landscape from being totally destroyed is affluent foreigners using the old vineyards as summer holiday homes.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/8/0/0/6/5/180065-natural-resistance-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=eeadc398e9"},{"name":"Priya","tagline":"","description":"Priya is an extended aerial shot of a twirling Kathak dancer.

The third section is a dramatic sequence based on one of the last scenes in John Cassavetes's film A Woman Under the Influence (1974). Lockhart refrains from reproducing the scene literally. Instead, she places and collapses several moments into one, amplifying the main theme of the film - the attempt to pretend that everything is okay.
