A satire of the Venetian merchant class, embodied by narrow-minded, complaining and intolerant men whose mistrust of the fairer sex borders on the absurd, The Boors perfectly illustrates Goldonis theatre, a theatre of life with a real content, characters observed in reality, and a natural expression. Thus, a theatre in which the man Voltaire described as natures son and painter scrutinises his contemporaries, their relationships and their social behaviour. His work served to entertain while providing posterity with an acute testimony of the morals of his time. Indeed, Jean-Louis Benoit warns against reducing the author to a simple photographer of reality.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/5/7/4/4/9/457449-les-rustres-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=3831678592"},{"name":"Sail","tagline":"","description":"Love letters never sent.

Most of the material in this work was made during weekend trips to the villages of the students, who invited me to stay with them. As such the film is an impressionistic glimpse of a non-touristic area of India, one of its poorer and less developed regions. It was my intention to capture more the spirit or sense of the place - the languid pacing of time, the light, the richness of color - than in any sense to make a clinical documentary about it. Included in the film, at the end, is a sequence of shots made by my students during the workshop conducted in Raipur.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"20th Century Masters - The Best of Cinderella: The DVD Collection","tagline":"","description":"Including the videos of Shake Me, Nobody's Fool, Don't Know What You Got (Till It's Gone), Coming Home and Heartbreak Station.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/9/6/7/4/4/696744-20th-century-masters-the-best-of-cinderella-the-dvd-colle-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=ded3149362"},{"name":"The Happiest Toddler on the Block","tagline":"","description":"In \\"The Happiest Toddler\\", Dr. Harvey Karp, noted pediatrician and child development expert, reveals a totally new and extraordinarily effective way to communicate with our \\"uncivilized\\" little toddlers.
