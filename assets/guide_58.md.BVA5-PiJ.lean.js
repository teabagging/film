It is only at the age of 42 that he starts directing, after having been an editor and a scriptwriter. In 1994, he directed his first film, \\"Regarde les hommes tomber\\", whose conflicting shooting was an ordeal for this misanthropic beginner. It was with \\"Sur mes lvres\\", in 2001, that he forged his cinematographic language: contained lyricism, deliberate imperfection of images, ellipses plunging the audience into a maelstrom of sensations. With each of his films, Jacques Audiard intends to renew himself, at the cost of challenges and doubts always more vivid.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/4/6/0/4/4/746044-jacques-audiard-le-cinema-a-cur-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=7b1b613db5"},{"name":"Glacier","tagline":"","description":"Two people are stuck in a quarantine hotel during a deadly pandemic.
