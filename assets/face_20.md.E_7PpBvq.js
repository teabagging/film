After the election, the project evolved into an analysis of the interaction between the natural, built, and social environments of the city. The issues of the campaign became frames through which to examine a deeper narrative of urban spatial systems.  The project evolved into a cinematic essay on the alignment, misalignment, and overlap of physical and social spaces.
