Beginning with a personal quest for understanding, the film moves into a year-long drama of human tragedy and redemption as principal character Cass comes to terms with his own mortality and attempts to lift himself out of his cycle of self-destruction. This core narrative carves an upward arc through an intimate study of a place often described as paradise, but which harbours an undertow of lethal hedonism and disillusionment. As people continue to kill themselves during the making of the film, a maelstrom of conflicting values throws up unexpected truths about the human condition.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/1/3/5/9/61359-shed-your-tears-and-walk-away-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=0c335b71ca"},{"name":"Russel Fish: The Sausage and Eggs Incident","tagline":"","description":"An award winning, quirky comedy starring Golden Globe Award Winner, Chris Colfer (Glee), as Russel Fish, an awkward teen who discovers he must pass the Presidential Physical Fitness Test or fail gym class and lose his admission to Harvard.

He is always making fun of everything wrong with the human behaviour such as stupidity, greed or vanity. His attitude and actions always bring damages to the mean, evil and materialistic people. So beside the jokes, the movie has this philosophical layer, undoubtedly because Pacala's independent way of being, free spirit and his love for the nature creates a way of seeing life, bringing joy. Filmed in a very beautiful part of Romania in 1974, the movie had an important success at that time and it is considered one of the most loved movies in Romania ever.  Like the hero, found in many stories and jokes, the movie forwards the spirit of true freedom and pure link with the nature, forgetting about times and governments.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/4/3/6/7/0/243670-pacala-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=05a5e8edb0"},{"name":"Cesar's Bark Canoe","tagline":"","description":"\\"This documentary depicts a canoe being built in the traditional manner.
