Loved Noahs footage too. You can tell more and more care is going into picking what tricks are getting done where (the nollie 180 to sw feeble into the bank was extra satisfying) and hes got that kind of natural board control that makes everything look super fun and playful (sort of like this guy).","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/3/2/0/4/8/832048-ace-trucks-turn-right-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=e5cb6b73a8"},{"name":"Joo de Deus, ombre et lumire","tagline":"","description":"Psychotherapist doctor and ethnologist filmmaker, Michel Meignant goes in 2015 to Brazil with his companion Anne, suffering from a cancer, to visit the medium Jo?o de Deus, famous for his miraculous healings. \\"It is not me who heals, it is God with the benevolent Entities\\" affirms Jo?o de Deus.

At one point, the women appear to be colorful cutouts moving jaggedly around the screen. In this film and in Hexagrams, Byron re-uses some of the same film scenes to create original content.  Festival of Cyclists was created using a film technique invented with a Bell and Howell Film 16mm camera. In this technique, a short loop of film is repeatedly printed onto the camera roll.

The camera follows Roelofs over the course of her last year as Georgias First Lady. Backed by a wealth of archive material, she talks about her love for her husband and his country, about how power changed him, and about their family life and the pain caused by their physical separation.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/5/4/3/4/6/254346-stand-by-your-president-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=48a538fa51"},{"name":"Dari Marusan","tagline":"","description":"Traditional Japanese wooden Daruma dolls have no ears.
