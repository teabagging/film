The British award winning director Katie Mitchell C took a revisionist approach to the drama, updating the action to the mid-19th century and applying a feminist slant as she added new and unexpected elements. The Financial Times wrote: Mitchell shows us on stage personal traumas that a self-respecting woman in the early 19th century was meant to keep to herself. It is a messy, bloody list  nocturnal sex trysts, a knife murder, a miscarriage, a suicide in the bath  In all this Damrau is brilliantly convincing.

The film explores various different aesthetic options. Lange begins by filming a bare tree, magnifying it and giving it the plastic seductivity of a watercolour in movement. The shots of the tree, either gently caressed by the artist's camera or exploding in a multitude of trembling and scratched forms, alternate with a series of shots of depressing new public-housing tower blocks. Lang revitalizes these buildings by clustering them together and/or blurring their contours. At a certain point, a building site appears; we see the buildings under construction, with construction workers busy at their task. Were these shots filmed later, or did the film-maker choose to show them later? It doesn't really matter; the alchemical phenomenon which mutates vegetation (nature) into the depressing uniformity of tower blocks is conveyed with sensitivity.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/9/5/5/2/4/595524-beton-arme-contre-dame-nature-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=1377916e27"},{"name":"The Keeper of Herds","tagline":"","description":"A documentary about a family of goat herders in Portugal and the relationship between man and animals.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/2/1/4/9/6/421496-o-guardador-de-rebanhos-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=d020f3d6ff"},{"name":"Versailles, the visit","tagline":"A private visit to the greatest castle in the world !","description":"You will discover the history of the palace as well as the masterpieces it houses.

Woods and Reginald Purdell and starring Max Miller and George E. Stone. It was made at Teddington Studios with sets designed by Peter Proud.  Unlike several of Miller's Teddington films which are now lost, this still survives.  Miller plays a fairground performer who meets a professor who claims to have invented a cheap substitute for petrol. They team up and persuade a millionaire to finance them to develop and market the product, while unsavoury elements are keen to steal the formula and try all means to get their hands on it, involving slapstick chases and double-crosses.
