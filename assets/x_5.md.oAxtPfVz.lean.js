In 2002, one service a day continued to Fishguard in connection with the ferry to the Emerald Isle. These are now history but Video 125 cameras managed to ride aboard a First Great Western 125 High Speed Train (HST) before the through services were abandoned. For most of our journey in the cab, we are travelling through Wales on the country's major main line - the South Wales. Engineered by I.K.Brunel, it was the last main line to be built to the 7ft broad gauge.  The double line eventually gives way to a single track at Clarbeston Road. The 3/4 mile Fishguard branch is worked by electric token.  The train calls at Bristol Parkway, Newport, Cardiff, Bridgend, Port Talbot, Neath, Swansea, and Whitland.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/9/2/4/2/8/492428-the-down-fishguard-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=8b037d7b13"},{"name":"Highland Main Line","tagline":"Perth to Inverness","description":"This Driver's eye view puts you in the cab of a brand new Scotrail Turbostar class 170 for the 118 mile trip over the Highland main line.  Perth is the gateway to the Highlands of Scotland and still boasts a large imposing station. The main line features stretches of double and single track with semaphore block signalling predominating to Aviemore.There are stiff climbs to the two summits at Druimuachdar and Slochd, the latter forming the summit of the Inverness cut-off line. This direct line from Aviemore to Inverness was a major feat of civil engineering forced upon the Highland Railway company by the threat of competition. It was completed in 1898 having taken 14 years to build.  The two largest structures spanning the rivers Findhorn and Nairn are seen, like the rest of the route, not just from the cab but from a helicopter flying overhead!","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/9/2/6/1/1/492611-highland-main-line-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=a4a6b50c0d"},{"name":"Elie Wiesel: First Person Singular","tagline":"","description":"Visual biography of Nobel Prize-winning author, Holocaust survivor, and human rights activist Elie Wiesel.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/1/8/7/6/1/1118761-elie-wiesel-first-person-singular-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=0f21dcb498"},{"name":"Nektar: Live","tagline":"","description":"When the news broke that the original line-up of Nektar would be performing at the Patriot Theatre in New Jersey for Nearfest 2002, tickets for the event sold out in just 45 minutes!

The 1940s tale of the puppy who learned a lesson is now a breezy, softer animated series along the lines of Little Bear. The five tales here are not from the original book but from writer Bruce Talkington, who created Poky's future adventure 50 years after the original book. Poky and his clan learn simple lessons in five 5-minute tales: \\"The Truth about Kittens and Puppies,\\" \\"Hungry Little Puppy,\\" What Goes Down, Must Come Up,\\" \\"The Ball,\\" and \\"Fraidy Pup.\\" The video is easy to recommend on rainy afternoons for the 2- to 5-year-old set.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"εʮ","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/9/9/7/8/7/899787--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=df2f0024dd"},{"name":"Hollywood Ghost Stories","tagline":"","description":"A chronicle of alleged ghosts, haunted landmarks and the otherworldly doings of Tinseltown, including a cursed script and haunted homes of the stars.

The narrator is Melanesian, and a female Talai villager tells of the threat of death to any female who witnesses the rituals of the society. A male villager explains the symbols painted on a Tubuan house, and a Christian priest relates what an initiate has told him about the importance of the ritual to him.
