In 1964, Edward Keall explored the ruins of the so-called Yazdegerds Castle, which local legends attributed to the last of the Sasanian king of kings. After he had secured a job in 1972 as a curator at the Royal Ontario Museum (Canada), Kealls proposal to re-activate his old exploration of the castle of King Yazdegerd was endorsed by the Iranian archaeological authorities. The first Canadian expedition was mounted in 1965; the last one was terminated abruptly in February 1979 when the Shah of Iran was toppled by the supporters of the Ayatollah Khomeini.

At first glance, one could mistakenly take this work to be a study of dead-media fetishism. However, one watches this suite unfold into a delicate investigation of the limits of technology, and the potential those limits enable. Through the use of preset wipes and crude RGB color palettes, Stratford uncovers hidden potential in what otherwise would be considered a long-outmoded device for creative expression. In doing so, the typical subversive gesture of using obsolete technology that occurs within contemporary art is supplanted by an earnest exploration into a crucial link between early video aesthetics and current technologically inflected imagery.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Acharam","tagline":"","description":"Acharam is a tamil movie.Ganesh and Rekha are doing the lead roles in this movie.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/7/5/9/9/9/275999-acharam-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=2a1d9560c1"},{"name":"Parallel Chords (Overture)","tagline":"","description":"Parallel Chords (overture) is the true story of a young violinist struggling to assert her individuality amidst the intense pressure of her pianist father and the formidable weight of her own musical ability.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/2/7/5/7/5/327575-parallel-chords-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=27a01c59b8"},{"name":"5 Masks","tagline":"","description":"A psychopathic robber, Walter Lari and his gang of criminals organize a last hit to a bank.
