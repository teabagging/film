Two woodland spirits decide to teach the miscreants a lesson, sending lightning down upon the hikers who become transformed into deer. However, the female spirit intercedes and the deer become human once more apart from one man who retains a pair of antlers.  This short film is a good example of the Sevenoaks Cine Society's award winning output, showing their innovative and creative approach to comic film-making.

Even as the movement of the skaters disrupts the contemplation of the motionless landscape, their position off-center reminds us of the background in Pieter Brueghels Hunters in the Snow, 1565.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/8/6/8/6/3/686863-algonquin-park-early-march-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=dd38a2855b"},{"name":"Elton John: The Royal Opera House","tagline":"","description":"Elton and his band are accompanied by London's Royal Academy of Music Orchestra and Choir, performing a rare concert at the legendary Royal Opera House, with songs that include Take Me To The Pilot, Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me, Burn Down The Mission and Philadelphia Freedom.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/8/1/7/4/0/981740-elton-john-the-royal-opera-house-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=0ba46dac9f"},{"name":"Girlie","tagline":"","description":"A love story which unfolds over three days and nights on the outskirts of the metropolis.

A 15-minute fragment with lovely scenes of a snowy cityscape of Turin surfaced in the early 1990 at the CNC in Paris, and was then identified as Oca alla Colbert (Eleuterio Rodolfi, 1913), because of the seamstresses masquerading as geese. After additional discoveries we could screen 30 minutes of the same French version at the Cinema Ritrovato 2009, in the section dedicated to Gigetta and Rodolfi. The storyline gave away the correct identification of I raggi Z, a 1917 Ambrosio production, whose director remains unknown. But would any other Italian director than Rodolfi be able to create a comedy of such elegant, warm-hearted humour and enticing brio, and set the stage so well for Gigettas wonderful acting?
