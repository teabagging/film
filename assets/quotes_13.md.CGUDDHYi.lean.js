The script for war as with Iraq in 2003 originated with Zionist partisans with Israeli interests in mind. From Oded Yinon to the Israeli \\"Clean Break\\" papers, the Zionist regime made it very clear what their intentions were in Iraq and Syria. American mass media had a uniform message that \\"Assad must go\\" for years until the Trump administration took power. In Iraq, after the US made it clear that they did not back Kurdish secession and would not give them air support, the Iraqi forces chased out the Peshmerga in a mere 36hrs. The world must know that the US was dragged into these conflicts via Israeli pressure and deceptions.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/4/3/4/5/4/443454-syria-israel-s-invisible-hand-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=3deca65f58"},{"name":"The Mission of Nagano","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/2/3/1/8/7/423187-la-mission-de-kent-nagano-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=ee6082addc"},{"name":"Oracle","tagline":"","description":"\\"A trio of long lost sisters make a documentary film about how to save the world and the true nature of humanity, on the eve of a possible apocalypse.\\" (taken from IMDB)","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/4/2/9/1/8/442918-oracle-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=83f2e9e17b"},{"name":"Thittivasal","tagline":"","description":"A collector, a cop and a minister want to displace a community of tribal people from their mountain homes for their personal gains.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/1/6/1/1/6/416116-thittivasal-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=a4f60e8741"},{"name":"Fury: Redux","tagline":"","description":"In this reboot of the 2005 Indie Classic, Attorney Laney McCoy begins an affair with a much younger man, only to spin out of control in a jealous rage.

The children remain in a home setting with their own bed central to the scene and the barest hint of a forest behind, while their father plays the witch as an amiable, totally benevolent figure, not sinister at all, even joining them in the final joyful ensemble. When they sing that the witch is dead, you find that the production contradicts that completely. Taking that unsinister stance means that the opera loses much of its bite. No doubt Felsenstein felt that it would make the piece more accessible for very young children, though many of them relish the sinister element. That said, it is a strong and capable performance, very well conducted and with a cast of good if not outstanding singers. One wonders what Felsenstein meant to convey, just as it is not clear why the central characters should regularly be carrying dolls.

This presentation examines a group of marginalized mixed-race Americans who are both multi-cultural and multi-ethnic.  This documentary is the first authentic treatment of a group of Americans who proudly identify themselves as creoles. It provides first-hand accounts of their experiences in New Orleans. After reconstruction, the Supreme Court decision, Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), divided America into two worlds: one white and one disenfranchised black. The Creole stories they tell in this documentary speak to the social history of the united states where the fruits of the american dream were rewarded to those with European features, light skin, and good hair. Often, survival meant giving up one's gens de couleur [colored people] identity to assimilate into white america. The process of becoming a productive american has been fraught with both rejection and racism for creoles of color. This is their story.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/7/7/7/6/2/377762-too-white-to-be-black-too-black-to-be-white-the-new-orlea-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=15b0211ba2"},{"name":"Les Carnets secrets de Nuremberg","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/8/0/2/4802-les-carnets-secrets-de-nuremberg-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=926ce6fb0c"},{"name":"Rep Yo Set: The Movie","tagline":"","description":"Rep Yo Set: The Movie takes viewers on a behind the scenes journey looking at the concept, history and culture of twenty seven of the most active gang neighborhoods in Los Angeles as they come together to record the historic Rep Yo Set Album.

This film shows how he has reinvented his role as an artist into a media personality and the status his works enjoy with a number of collectors who have allowed him to fulfil his dreams.

After a while though, he starts missing real fights and the fact that he has no opponents to fight anymore saddens him. As a result, he starts hurting people in order to satisfy his need for quarrel. He later finds a proper opponent, but he dies of a bee sting. This enrages Domrol no end, and he starts cussing at God. At that moment, the angel of death appears before him and informs him that should he fail to find a volunteer who would be willing to die for him before the sunrise, his own life will be taken. Domrol begs his parents, but they refuse to do such a sacrifice. Finally his wife accepts to surrender to the angel of death instead of Domrol, but after God sees their pure love, he forgives them.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/3/6/9/4/4/836944-domrol-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=99d030c6d5"},{"name":"Mohabbat Ki Arzoo","tagline":"","description":"Orphaned Motor Mechanic Raja (Rishi Kapoor) likes to live it up on pay-day, which is the first of every month, and behaves like a very rich man, in a borrowed garage car.

Entitled Freeze, it was a huge critical and commercial success, propelling Hirst and the group into the spotlight of the avant-garde.  More than five years later, Hirst exhibits to international acclaim and is regularly derided in the tabloid press.  This portrait of Hirst, which resumes the Omnibus season, is presented as a drug-induced nightmare after Hirst has been put to sleep by a sinister dentist, played by Donald Pleasence. In between interviews with fellow  Freeze artists including Angus Fairhurst , Sarah Lucas and Tracey Emin , Hirst is seen preparing Mother and Child Divided, his work for last year's Venice Blennale. The piece consists of a cow and a calf, each sawn in half, pickled in formaldehyde and exhibited in four tanks.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/2/1/7/9/1/1121791-freeze-but-is-it-art--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=c3fef2c0bb"},{"name":"No","tagline":"","description":"When Abdel Mutaal Mahjoub is wrongfully accused and imprisoned, and things are made worse when he's presumed dead, he suddenly finds himself secluded, and recollections of his past life come creeping in, making him a prisoner of his own mind.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/9/7/9/7/4/897974-no-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=9038c41b17"},{"name":"John Michael Montgomery - Kickin' It Up","tagline":"Everyone is talking about country's hottest star...","description":"Featuring: I Swear, Rope The Moon, Beer & Bones, I Love The Way You Love Me, Life's A Dance + Never before seen interviews.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/4/9/7/6497-john-michael-montgomery-kickin-it-up-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=ce32019c54"},{"name":"Alex et Marie","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Bald-Cop and Girl Student","tagline":"","description":"Hong Kong bald detective Cheng Chang, who went to the mainland on vacation, met Liu Bingbing, a female student of the Police Officer University who worked in the hotel during the summer vacation.
