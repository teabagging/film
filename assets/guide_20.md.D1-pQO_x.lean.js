INVESTIGATION OF A FLAME is an intimate, experimental documentary portrait of the Catonsville Nine, this disparate band of resisters who chose to break the law in a defiant, poetic act of civil disobedience. How did the photos, trial publicity and news of the two year prison sentences help to galvanize a disillusioned American public? INVESTIGATION OF A FLAME explores this politically and religiously motivated performance of the 1960s in the context of extremely different times, times in which critics of Middle East peace agreements, abortion and technology resort to violence of the most random and sanguine kind in order to access the public imagination.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/5/8/8/8/4/358884-investigation-of-a-flame-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=0b4a1719f4"},{"name":"Plan B","tagline":"Ready, Fire...

Through a wordplay with the religious connotation of the names of the two men, murdered during the worker strikes of the late 1970s in S?o Paulo, it associates sainthood and Christ himself with the working class. That association is reaffirmed throughout the film, from the very beginning, including by a priest. The martyrdom of metalworkers Nelson Pereira de Jesus and Santo Dias da Silva is the starting point to denounce the working conditions faced by factory workers, and the repression which ensues whenever they try to resist them. However, the film also presents us with the 'official' version of the facts, going so far as to feature interviews with the man who killed Nelson. Obviously, it sides with the workers, as it conveys the strength of the oppressed and the impudence of the oppressors.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/8/2/4/9/9/382499-santo-and-jesus-metalworkers-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=84bbb3f911"},{"name":"Eunice","tagline":"","description":"Moments in four different years in the lives of the Harper family beginning with 1955 as a hopeful Eunice prepares to go to a party, and her brother Phillip, a recent college graduate, departs for New York.
