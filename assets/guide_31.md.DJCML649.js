The film focuses on the visual quality of the pulsating shadows that intrude the suburban domestic sphere and disrupt the social and psychological equilibrium of the community.  Documentary images are complemented with a female voiceover, which is based on multiple interviews that were transcripted and assembled into a single narration. The film slowly uncovers fragmentary memories from the time when the flicker began. An atmosphere of suspense and intangible fear is generated throughout the film, while the actual source of the flickering lights remains unknown.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/4/9/0/6/6/349066-ocean-hill-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=b7ea0ec4cd"},{"name":"Summer","tagline":"","description":"It is summer and it is hot.

How We Used To Live is effectively a prequel to Finisterre, a meditation on London life today and a glance back at a receding Britain. Using colour footage from the 1950s to the 1980s, taken from the BFI National Archive, the film covers the New Elizabethan age from the optimism of the post-war era to the dawn of Thatcherism. Soundtracked by Saint Etiennes Pete Wiggs and scripted by the bands Bob Stanley with Travis Elborough, the film is for anyone who has ever tried to understand their city.
