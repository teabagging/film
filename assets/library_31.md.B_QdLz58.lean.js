An estimated 2 million families in the U.S. have at least one spouse who identifies as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgendered.

Granted, the space we enter with them is not one of healthy connections between human beings encountering each other in a functional polis. Clearly, theirs is a world of radical disconnects. At the same time, however, it is a world in which people invent highly idiosyncratic lives for themselves - if there is one thing missing here it is precisely uniformity - and in which imaginaries go haywire. Indubitably, the Hardy/Bouwer airport lounge is a dystopian space and this space, it seems fair to say, functions as a synecdoche for a larger social condition.
