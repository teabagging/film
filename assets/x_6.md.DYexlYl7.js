A fixed set portraying the sun deck and furnishings of a spa hotel (using only the stage front) provides the operas eclectic group of European aristocrats an unexpectedly informal aspect from the outset, replete with bathrobes, towels and slippers. This is novel, but confuses the audience as to who is who in the story.

Subtitle is equal to public: By this documentary I want to show how a cinephile makes a link with film and makes effect to more cinephile in such a special situation in China. This documentary also displays a tip of the iceberg of the cinephile cultural history in China.  Subtitle is equal to privacy: I hope to experience the progress of subtitle translation again, in order to cast my ambition and burden in the old days. I want to say goodbye to that ego with subtitle translation and move forwards to that ego with indie-documentary direction. I want to search more possibilities to the films.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Hvordan vi alle spille vil","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"ȫѲ¸绪վ","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/2/6/9/4/4/826944--2017-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=28289cbc0c"},{"name":"Children in Gold","tagline":"","description":"\\"Three documentary poems\\" show Syrian refugees landing on Lesbos, Greece in the fall of 2015 while tourists gawk at them and aid workers assist them.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"The Music Box","tagline":"","description":"After Gloria finds an old box in her cellar, her life is shaded with bursts of terror.
