At the time the film was made, there were over 3000 children living in Germany who'd been fathered by African American GIs. Referred to as \\"mischlings,\\" these children were often treated as outcasts because of their illegitimacy and skin color. One such mischling is Toxi (played by herself), who is sent to live with her American father when her mother dies. At first, Toxi is welcomed with opened arms, but the father, who already has two children, has neither the time nor the money to care for the girl. Toxi is then bundled off to an orphanage, sparking a serious rift in her father's family. By concentrating on a highly fictionalized plotline, Toxi tends to ignore the thousands of other mischlings whose lives are far more complex and tragic than that of the film's central character.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/6/7/9/5/106795-toxi-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=cecf6df637"},{"name":"Fifa e arena","tagline":"","description":"In Napoli, Nicolino Capece, a truthful pharmacist clerk becomes erroneously recognized as a dangerous Spanish criminal and decides to escape to Spain.

When Alonzo Mournings no. 1 seed Georgetown Hoyas entered the tournament, they had their eyes set on the Final Four and a national title. Dealing with the likes of Ivy League champion and no. 16 seed Princeton was more of an afterthought. So when these two teams faced off on March 17, 1989, in Providence, Rhode Island, no one, not even Princeton, expected much of a game. They were all wrong. Pete Carrils Tigers not only played one of the greatest games in college basketball history, they also let the NCAA and the rest of the world know that the mid-majors could play and were here to stay. Without that game, the tournament would not be what it is today  a billion-dollar enterprise that stops America for two weeks each year.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/6/0/4/9/7/260497-the-billion-dollar-game-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=e83481bb9a"},{"name":"Under a Changing Sky","tagline":"","description":"Sous un ciel changeant.

Maybe she's a realist or has learned tough lessons from life; either way, she cares about her personal safety and may even find salvation, comfort or something satisfying in possessing a gun. In a word, she is empowered.  Breaking through the caricatures, A Girl and a Gun reveals America's diverse and far-ranging female gun community.
