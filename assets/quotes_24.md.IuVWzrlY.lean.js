But in seeing Afghanistan as a problem, the people of the country, and their desire for self-determination, are often overlooked.  From the Soviet invasion and the mujahideen resistance to the Taliban and the American occupation, A Darkness Visible: Afghanistan examines thirty years of Afghan history. It is the story of ordinary citizens whose lives play out in the shadow of superpowers. There are tales of violence to be sure, but there is also love and even romance.  Based on 14 trips to Afghanistan between 1994 and 2010, A Darkness Visible: Afghanistan is the work of renowned photojournalist Seamus Murphy.

She is a colortura soprano with a light sound, she was a student of Toti dal Monte and had a span at the MET from 1961 to 1968, where she shared productions with singers like Sutherland, Scotto, and Peters. If you like your belcanto with plenty of high notes (plenty of high d's and e's)you will enjoy her performance. Her mad scene (only slightly cut) is a high point in the performance as are all the scenes she's in. The rest of the cast is good and the Arturo Luciano Saldari sings well minus a high note or two. The main drawback here is the score is cut by over 40 mins. I am guessing that is was the tradition of the time. Overall a nice vintage performance.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/1/1/6/1/5/511615-bellini-i-puritani-and-arias-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=416b202799"},{"name":"Dwight Yoakam: Live from Austin TX","tagline":"","description":"Originally recorded on October 23, 1988 and edited for a 30-minute broadcast, Austin City Limits and New West Records have collaborated to release this sparkling performance given by Dwight and his early band, in its entirety.
