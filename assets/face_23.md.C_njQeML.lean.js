A few years ago, Laura (Chortle Awards nominee) evolved into a full-time wife and comedian. It didn't quite go as planned.  Following her smash debut Lovely', Laura aims her trademark comedy kaleidoscope at marriage, feminism, identity and the grinning idiots that built Stonehenge. Indulge in a whirlwind celebration of everything that's right about slowly turning into your mother and everything that's wrong with town criers.  30-something Laura's take on life is infectiously optimistic. Her clever tales of David Attenborough obsessions and dealing with a Daily Mail reading parent ooze with charisma and vibrant charm.

Super-8 imagery of moments shared with family in and around Naress English family home is replete with playfulness and a meditative quality that oscillates between tender and somber. The everyday is subject to formal and metaphysical questioning in a portrait of a young artist along a personal journey. Unfinished at the time, this screening premieres the artists own digital restoration of this rarely seen and evocative work. Back in New York, the short Waiting for the Wind is an energetic study of the artist's body in motion in his sparse apartment.
