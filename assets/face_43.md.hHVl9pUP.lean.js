The metal items painted in the same colorsyellow, red and bluewere manufactured from the materials used in the production of military equipment.

Kankkunen had won the Acropolis in 1986 on his way to the World Championship, and was confident of giving the Martini Racing Team victory. But on the demanding, dusty back lanes and tracks of the Kamena Vourla, the stronger challenge was thought to be more likely from the big Nissans.
