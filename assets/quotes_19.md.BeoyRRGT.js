When Mark Duggan was shot by the police the scene was set for a confrontation but it was not the first time. In this grass-roots documentary we hear why Tottenham burned, show how the flames spread and look at the deep-rooted reasons that have set fires blazing in the last three decades. Four people in this small community, all black and working class, have died at the hands of the police and this film retraces their story. Powerful witness testimonies are balanced against police reaction to the violence that exploded and the film offers a fresh political analysis of the cause of the uprising. Exploring ideas of collective memory Burn is poetry for the people. This radical film bears witness that only justice for those that have died at the hands of the police can put out the fires.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Eric Prydz live at Ultra Music Festival 2014","tagline":"Live at Ultra","description":"Eric Prydz live at Ultra Music Festival 2014","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/4/5/2/3/5/345235-eric-prydz-live-at-ultra-music-festival-2014-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=07896e0e9f"},{"name":"Digital Landscaping","tagline":"","description":"By using digital photo editing program Photoshop, reproduced buildings are forming layers and being stacked as the size of them are regulated in perspective.

Wielemans does not travel along with the different tribes, but focuses his inquisitive camera on a small store in the desert. On a micro level, this meeting place constitutes a socio-economic gauge of the Tuareg's living conditions and manners. At the same time, it is the reflection of some tribesmen's underlying desire to abandon their wandering existence. Owing to a combination of stills that momentarily freeze a couple of tribesman and loosely shot images of meetings, anticipated or not, Tchisste, le miroir Tuareg transcends the common ethnographic documentary. With philosophical reflections on the influence of his camera lens on both subjects and filmmakers, the young director explores the cinematic language.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/1/5/5/5/3/915553-tchissete-le-miroir-touareg-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=6f0ff0ae57"},{"name":"Undo - um Conto de Fadas do Sc.
