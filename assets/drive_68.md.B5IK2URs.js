Perhaps a country whose 20th Century, dominated by its authoritarian ruler Enver Hoxha, was so traumatic, should allow its film heritage to fade away? Perhaps a national forgetting should be welcomed? Influenced by the films of Chris Marker, Cousins' film broadens to consider the architecture of dictators and the great icon paintings of Onufri. In the past, when cartographers knew little about a country, they wrote on it Here be Dragons. Albania was, for decades, one of the least well know countries in the world.

It ends as it began, as one long chain that can be interrupted at any point, and yet can only be seen as a whole piece.\\" - Margaret Ganahl, Camera Obscura","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/5/0/8/6/6/450866-saving-the-proof-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=977707449b"},{"name":"Star Pink","tagline":"","description":"The Pink Panther operates a gas station for space ships, and ends up battling a space villain.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/1/4/4/6/9/314469-star-pink-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=853eceaaa6"},{"name":"Amir Hamza the Lover and the Dancing Zebra","tagline":"","description":"The story between a lover and mistress based on fable story that show his attempt to defeat the demon and married with the girl.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/3/4/8/4/0/634840-amir-hamza-the-lover-and-the-dancing-zebra-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=8671e9792e"},{"name":"The Scarlet Pinkernel","tagline":"","description":"The Pink Panther is inspired by The Scarlet Pimpernel, and decides to rescue dogs captured by the local dog catcher.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/1/4/4/3/2/314432-the-scarlet-pinkernel-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=44a3979699"},{"name":"The Virgin Goddess","tagline":"She had to remain a virgin or die!","description":"Reworking of H.

Rouse takes the easy route with jokes aimed straight for the heart of the rowdy audience (sex, booze, drugs), Giraldo mixes gags based around fatherhood with some political humor, while Cook, whose status has blossomed to near-superstardom thanks to tours like this, is broad and fairly foul-mouthed, but gives an engagingly manic performance, which is well received by the heavily lubricated twenty-something crowd.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/7/7/6/2/27762-dave-attell-s-insomniac-tour-uncensored--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=92d53c9b0e"},{"name":"Hotel Diaries: B & B","tagline":"","description":"The perception of an Anglo-American hotel room is coloured by new revelations about The War on Terror and The Special Relationship that exists between Britain and the USA.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/0/8/9/6/8/308968-hotel-diaries-b-b-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=9a30a88ee1"},{"name":"The Dominici Affair by Orson Welles","tagline":"","description":"In 1956, Orson Welles directed 'The Tragedy of Lurs', an episode of the television series 'Around the World' that was inspired by the murder of a British family near the Dominici farm.
