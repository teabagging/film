The production features the three greatest exponents of their respective roles at the time: Grace Bumbrys magnificently seductive-toned Carmen, Mirella Frenis ineffably lovely, touching Mica?la and Jon Vickerss thrillingly manic-depressive Don Jos.  On its release the film was hailed by Die Presse, (Vienna) as a unique artistic event, while Le Monde felt that Karajans production brought a whole new dimension to the opera, combined with a magisterial interpretation.

This early film about the Southern California Renaissance Fair, with Les Blank as cameraman, is shot in sensuous detail on a 16mm Bell & Howell camera. It is apparent in this early work that Blank was already developing his own unique style of shooting. Film to tape transfer of a scratchy work print copy is all that remains of the original film.
