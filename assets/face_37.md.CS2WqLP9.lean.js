In June, 1864, President Abraham Lincoln signed the Yosemite Grant, making it a California State Park. It became famous through  the writings of Horace Greeley and the efforts of John Muir. Cinematographer Dennis Burkhart captures in this video the magnificence of Yosemite Valley (El Capitan, Bridalveil Fall, Half Dome), the High Sierra (John Muir Trail, Tuolumne Meadows, Tioga Pass) and the Mariposa Grove of giant sequoias. The camera catches the wildlife that roams the 1,1170 square miles of Yosemite, i.e. the mule deer, mountain lion, black bear, coyotes, bighorn sheep, and the rare peregrine falcon. This video  reveals why 3.8 million visitors come each year and stand before awe-inspiring panoramas they will never forget.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/4/6/1/4/1/746141-the-story-of-yosemite-national-park-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=01cce49103"},{"name":"Andha Diganta","tagline":"","description":"Plot Unavailable.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Love Game","tagline":"","description":"Dana, a famous lesbian tennis player meets a girl she wants to get to know.

However, the customer did not accept the proposal, deeming it unsuitable due to the too modern graphics for the time and the scenes of violence. However, Pascali continued to develop the subject by intervening on the style of the characters, creating sketches and sets and creating the basis for an independent animated film. In 1967 a trailer lasting 1'37 was made and proposed to the Cineriz production house, which appreciated the project but did not want to produce it because they considered it too sophisticated. Despite the second refusal, Pino Pascali continued to work on this project until the summer of 1968, when his life was cut short by a road accident.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/3/4/1/6/1/1034161-i-killers-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=401320da59"},{"name":"Shutter","tagline":"","description":"Piece in which Dieter Meier, to whom Markopoulos once dedicated a feature film, displaces his visage through the shutter of the film camera.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Timepiece","tagline":"","description":"A round-the-world, round-the-clock picture of the activities of the RAF in the mid-1960s.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"I'm Going to Ask You to Get Up Out of Your Seat","tagline":"","description":"A BAFTA award nominated BBC feature following American evangelist Billy Graham on his Greater London crusade, centred on Earl's Court in June 1966","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Nei sotterranei","tagline":"","description":"Short film by Franco Vaccari.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Bibi Andersson, Ingmar Bergman, and Liv Ullmann on PERSONA","tagline":"","description":"In the following excerpt from an interview originally recorded for Swedish television in 1966, PERSONAs director and lead actors discuss the evolution of the film and their individual interpretations of it.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Standgericht","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"ԧߧ","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/9/6/4/5/0/796450--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=0a392d8c7b"},{"name":"Bharia Mela","tagline":"","description":"a romance/musical?

The film addresses the consequences of his journey when racist classmates decide to take revenge as his new-found knowledge is seen a betrayal of the Sweden they know. The film also depicts how ethnic Swedes have been subjected to racism as well as how people in Sweden have worked against racism. The film is unique in addressing the less known parts of Swedish history. The main purpose is to demonstrate that it is possible to stop hate crimes through increased knowledge and that it is up to the individual to stand up for what is right.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"We Are Yesterday, Today, & Tomorrow","tagline":"","description":"Who am I?
