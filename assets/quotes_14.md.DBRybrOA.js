It becomes a layered, timeless drama in which Norma is the archetypal successful woman struggling to retain her dominant but vulnerable position. Hasmik Papian's lyrical and intense interpretation of the title role accentuates the striking similarity between a Druid high priestess and a modern opera diva. Conductor Julian Reynolds guides the brilliant cast, choir and Netherlands Chamber Orchestra to great heights, providing a refreshing new take on the chef doeuvre of bel canto.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/1/9/3/0/3/319303-norma-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=56d987d1d0"},{"name":"ԧ ާڧާ ߧ","tagline":"","description":"Two thiefs are trying to steal a big expensive necklace from an old lady in Odessa","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/6/9/6/4/5/269645---0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=b3a2be34d4"},{"name":" ?

With a career that spanned more than three decades and books that strengthened a nation with it's history, at the time of his death Michael King was one of New Zealand's most beloved writers. King's ability to cross cultural boundaries and delve deep into sometimes controversial areas greatly enriched New Zealand's recorded history. His tragic death early in 2004 was an enormous loss to this country. His insatiable curiosity fed New Zealand an extraordinary run of books, culminating in his last, The Penguin History of New Zealand, which was a publishing sensation. History Man, a feature length documentary, follows in the steps of Michael King on a journey through his own past - to childhood places where the sense of New Zealand and his own New Zealand-ness first struck him, the places his work steered him, and some of the characters he met along the way.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/6/1/5/0/5/761505-michael-king-history-man-a-documentary-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=c11bab9989"}]`),L={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:I,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},H={class:"card-container"},P=["disabled"],R={key:0},F={key:1};function E(s,i,t,m,l,o){const c=f("PoemCard");return a(),n("section",null,[i[1]||(i[1]=e("div",{class:"top-banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[e("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎬 Movie Showcase 🥳")])],-1)),e("div",H,[(a(!0),n(u,null,b(o.visiblePoems,(h,p)=>(a(),y(c,{key:p,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),o.hasMorePoems?(a(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:l.isLoading,onClick:i[0]||(i[0]=(...h)=>o.loadMore&&o.loadMore(...h))},[l.isLoading?(a(),n("span",F,"Loading...")):(a(),n("span",R,"See more"))],8,P)):w("",!0)])}const W=d(L,[["render",E],["__scopeId","data-v-a5d5794d"]]),G=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/14.md","filePath":"quotes/14.md"}'),N={name:"quotes/14.md"},J=Object.assign(N,{setup(s){return(i,t)=>(a(),n("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{G as __pageData,J as default};
