The ensembles are especially impressive, building to satisfying heights of emotional release for the singers and the audience. And Placido Domingo is a wonder to behold and hear.

Now shes back in her homeland, in Warsaw. She is old. Her body is decaying and shes basically waiting until the angels come to fetch her. The filmmaker is aware of Jadwigas old age and approaching demise, but he also sees much beauty in her appearance. He juxtaposes her wrinkled face with the guilty Polish landscape. At the most intimate of moments, he does not look away and continues to seek beauty in fragility. The woman no longer leaves her house, but the filmmaker does.

The most basic public services such as roads and water run along the lines of money and in the poorer parts of town life breaks down. There is insecurity everywhere; privatisation threatens more jobs, social security is a misnomer and the land can be bought from under your feet. Immigration from South America and the far-east increases while middle class populations dwindle. A small clique presides over the image of the city, but it is a city that they hardly know.
