Could unobstructed vision and locomotion be conditioned by the obfuscation of the self as an unreliable discerning and driving force ?","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Xanat - A flornographic movie","tagline":"","description":"A modern and mythical celebration of the Divine Feminine, inspired by the Mexican myth of Xanat, the rebel princess who defied her fathers orders to be with her poet musician lover. Murdered together for eloping, their mingled blood creates the first vanilla orchid, and with it, the birth of a fully embodied woman who becomes conscious of herself. This Super 8 film joyfully celebrates femininity, presenting a sensual journey through different forms and experiences. XANAT is deep, tangible and radical. This is very much an embodied film, both in form and in process, and entirely hand-developed and hand-edited. The soundtrack is made by the filmmaker, her partner, and their children.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Reinas del tupper sex","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/0/8/2/6/5/1108265-reinas-del-tupper-sex-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=654f3a87da"},{"name":"Star Crossed","tagline":"","description":"While mourning the loss of her family, a woman battling her inner demons wins the Mega Millions.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Բ2024ʢ","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/0/8/6/7/0/1108670-2024-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=33cff8c5aa"},{"name":"Journey to Bakhmut","tagline":"A director visits his best friend, an award-winning cinematographer, on the frontlines of the war in Ukraine.","description":"A director returns to visit his friend and cinematographer on the front lines.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/5/2/1/7/7/1152177-journey-to-bakhmut-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=2f8657dec8"},{"name":"Moothakudi","tagline":"","description":"Villagers protest against the opening of a liquor shop in Moothakudi since alcohol claimed many lives in the 1970s.
