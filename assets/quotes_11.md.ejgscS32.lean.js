In Untitled (Zimbabwean Queen of Rave) I combine some of these elements and also later events such as my experience of attending large public raves in Europe and later in Zimbabwe.

After editing the film, I had the entire six-minute film blueprinted as a black and white scroll.

Legend has it that Tiagong Akyat possessed an amulet that made him invisible.
