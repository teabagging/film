Shot in Iran, where reality shows are not yet widespread, Restored Communication stages candidates cut off from the world, who replay different seizures of power in various political contexts. In this system, as artificial as it is liberal, the competitors are locked up, filmed without interruption and subjected to the injunctions of a voice-over. Deprived of food, the voice, and contact with the outside world, they seem helpless, reflecting the stereotypical image of Irans geopolitical isolation. Between schoolboyish fiction and documentary, the film slowly turns into a scathing genre film in which even a water pistol can kill.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Dream Man","tagline":"","description":"Following the disappearance of his girlfriend, a young man named Phong investigated a mysterious figure online who is believed to cause the deaths of those who 'friend' him on Facebook and his nickname is \\"Dream Man\\", including deaths of Phong's friends who is Thao and Thang.

It may even resemble a gilded prison, creating a form of extreme solitude, unless it is shared and becomes public. With what it has become today, this place fulfils its destiny, which was perhaps inscribed at its creation in the form of its architecture, too pure and too monumental to make it a private place.

This statement encapsulates great operatic themes, and it is the culmination of an opera that reveals the passions of characters who live among palace intrigues. Written in the mature period of the leader of Italian romanticism, the opera displays a great vocal virtuosity, and is an example of Donizetti prizing the voice above all in the genre. The staging, by South African director Alessandro Talevi, who has been very successful in great opera houses as well as with more experimental theatre, places the play in an undetermined period, focusing on the chiaroscuro. Bruno Campanella conducts.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/7/1/3/2/8/871328-roberto-devereux-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=b6e04dec00"},{"name":"Thanksgiving Guest","tagline":"","description":"Mashed potatoes, new moms, and a man off CraigsList?
