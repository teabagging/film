The peculiarity of this edition is the format 720x480 (16:9) (against 4:3 in the previous edition), as well as the sound of dts 5.1, a different order of songs, a different boxing design and, as it seemed to me, a slightly different shooting. Although I didnt understand exactly, since the wide screen gives a different feeling. The quality of the video recording, in my opinion, is much worse than 4:3, but I did not closely compare. This DVD can only be of interest to true fans of Donna Summer, who want to have a favorite in all variants and angles.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/2/7/7/6/7/1027767-donna-summer-live-from-new-york-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=337a520fe6"},{"name":"Egypt Light of the World","tagline":"","description":"Determine for yourself whether the mysteries of ancient Egypt have influenced modern culture in this thought-provoking program, which posits that many elements of the Judeo-Christian belief system were actually derived from Egyptian lore.

What the film tries to convey is that crazy people are not in a static state of madness, but evolve, just as these athletes are somehow changing and evolving the sport.  After California, the next location was Hawaii, not only for the potential of the waves but also for the light for filming. Finally, several image intensives were held in Brazil, between March and October.  The film was produced completely independently and all ideas for the script, direction and images captured are by Pablo Aguiar.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/4/2/3/0/2/942302-madness-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=2655e19989"},{"name":"Mathias","tagline":"","description":"The video called Mathias plays ellipses in an interview entirely redesigned, of a video game player to MMO.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Mat Superhero","tagline":"","description":"An average Joe finds his calling after saving the life of a woman attempting suicide.
