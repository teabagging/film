The focus, which is beyond moral judgment, lies on various forms of expression and other, possible approaches and representations of reality.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"La femme  l'ombre","tagline":"","description":"A TV movie that tells the story of a woman ready to do anything to protect her child, is above all a hymn to the couple, to the family... to love in short.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/7/1/6/4/8/871648-la-femme-a-l-ombre-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=5ae8d5abf0"},{"name":"Chuushingura ~Scattered Flowers, Scattered Snow~","tagline":"","description":"Takarazuka Snow Troupe 1992-93 production based on The 47 Ronin.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/2/4/8/0/5/1024805-chuushingura-scattered-flowers-scattered-snow--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=a22f863fb0"},{"name":"The dancer and the jailer","tagline":"The dancer and the jailer","description":"A love story arises between the dancer (Aida Riad) and Corporal Hassan, who lives with her in the neighborhood of the castle on the roofs of a real estate and suffering from his wise friend for the multiplicity of women's relations ..","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/6/4/4/1/7/564417-the-dancer-and-the-jailer-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=370ca89e23"},{"name":"Kiss, Kiss, Dahlings","tagline":"","description":"This short comedy about the love of acting features a grandmother, daughter, and granddaughter in three different eras: first backstage at the Moscow Art Theatre in 1900, then backstage at a college theater in 1956, and finally, in the make-up room of the Charlie Rose television program in 1992.

We travel to Egypt to see how such monumental masterpieces as the Great Pyramid, Library at Alexander, Temple of Karnak, Sphinx, and the obelisks were built using only primitive tools and brute labor. Host Michael Guillen demonstrates how ancient Egyptians might have leveled 13 acres of ground to within two inches before building the pyramids.
