In the midst of the Furie's own remembrances, he directs two last personal projects, shot digitally on shoestring budgets, from the first solo scripts he has written since 1961. 'Drive Me to Vegas and Mars' is a comedy about aging and letting go, while 'Hannah Cohen' is a Holocaust-themed love story set and shot in Israel. Sidney J. Furie: Fire Up the Carousel is an intimate portrait of a unique, prolific, and quietly influential filmmaker, a man with an impressive resum who has stood behind the camera on great films such as The Ipcress File (1965), Lady Sings the Blues (1972), The Boys in Company C (1978), The Leather Boys (1964), The Entity (1982), The Appaloosa (1966), Little Fauss and Big Halsy (1970), and many others.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/1/3/7/8/2/1113782-sidney-j-furie-fire-up-the-carousel--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=55091a5fd1"},{"name":"Signes Song","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Sign Of Omission","tagline":"","description":"Two co-writers are forced to confront not just their grammatical differences, but the negative impact their script has had on their personal relationship.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/7/4/2/1/6/1074216-sign-of-omission-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=4b071fff04"},{"name":"Silent Song","tagline":"","description":"Silent Song brings new life to a remarkable piece of 1945 footage found by chance in an archive.

The first two films of the trilogy, Zyklon Portrait (13min. 1999) and The Walnut Tree (11min. 2000) have been seen in 20 countries around the globe, garnering numerous awards.  In the pandemonium of the liberation of Nazi concentration camp Dachau, a U.S. army cameraman filmed a young boy playing the accordian. This strangely poetic moment offers an unusual contrast to the all-too-familiar WWII liberation images of emaciated prisoners in striped uniforms.  Silent Song is a contemplation on the ephemeral nature of life, images and history. This fleeting moment was recorded and thus became an object - the film that is now part of the United States national Archives.

The accident happened in Ashtabula, Ohio on December 29, 1876 during a raging blizzard, sending the luxury train crashing 70-feet into a river gorge and costing the lives of 97 people. The disaster shocked the nation, yet its a story thats been lost in the pages of history.
