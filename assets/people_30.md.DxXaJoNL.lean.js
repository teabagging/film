After showing how consumer capitalism has become economically and environmentally unsustainable, Lewis explores how our cultural and information industries make it difficult to envision other forms of human progress by limiting critical thinking and keeping us locked in a cycle of consumption. And he argues that change will only be possible if we take culture seriously and transform the very way we organize our media and communications systems.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/3/6/5/4/2/636542-consumerism-the-limits-to-imagination-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=1095776aa8"},{"name":"Hyena","tagline":"","description":"Three men are lost in Africa.

Iceland took steps to protect their fishing industry - the mainstay of their economy - resulting in the three so-called Cod Wars. This was a David and Goliath struggle, where the small fleet of Icelandic gunboats were pitted against the British trawlers and the Royal Navy in the North Atlantic.

Timehri was also then the name of the international airport at Georgetown, Guyana's capital, where Williams stops off to restore an earlier mural.  The film offers a rare insight into life beyond Georgetown, what Williams calls the real Guyana. Before moving to England in 1952 he had been sent to work on a sugar plantation in the jungle; this is his first chance to revisit the region and the Warao Indians - formative influences on his work - in four decades. Challenging the ill-treatment of indigenous Guyanese, Williams explored the potential of art to change attitudes. By venturing beyond his British studio, this film puts his work into vibrant context.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":" ߧ էѧܧߧ","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/1/4/9/0/0/414900---0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=fc3e437b1f"},{"name":"Ballad of Old Weapons","tagline":"","description":"An old woman from Caucasian Mountains goes to the front line do give her sons weapons of their ancestors.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/1/8/7/4/6/318746-ballad-of-old-weapons-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=975c91cb2e"},{"name":"Van Halen - Unleashed","tagline":"","description":"Van Halen \\"Unleashed\\" was a documentary produced and aired on MTV first in 1986 and repeatedly through 1987.

The reasons for this lay in the concealment of a neo-Nazi scene that had already grown stronger in the 1980s and was officially not allowed to exist in the anti-fascist GDR. The failure to deal with the National Socialist past and the Holocaust in schools and in society over the past 40 years were further reasons. There was hardly any understanding of democracy.

Other than the generic allusion that Jesus advanced in wisdom, stature, and in favor with God and man (Luke 2:52), the Bible gives nothing more about Jesus' life during this time span.  A common assumption amongst Christians is that Jesus simply lived in Nazareth during that period, but there are various accounts that present other scenarios, including travels to India.  Today, scholars are forming a clearer picture of his life by re-examining stories in the New Testament gospels and connecting them with new archeological discoveries.  A narrative rich in details and subtle clues begins to emerge. Go back to Nazareth in 6 A.D. to learn more about the blue-collar village, its oppressed inhabitants and abusive Roman rulers to see how it shaped Jesus personality and beliefs.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/5/3/3/0/1/353301-the-missing-years-of-jesus-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=e89e5e8afd"},{"name":"Fight: War Of Words - The Film","tagline":"","description":"Limited autographed two disc (DVD + CD) edition.
