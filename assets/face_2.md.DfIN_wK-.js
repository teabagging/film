At the beginning the off camera narrator points out a scandalous discrepancy. The film crew spent two days in the recording studio observing a three minute piece of music being produced. The film itself condenses the duration of production: 15 minutes into the film, the narrator announces that the producers are satisfied with the basic backing-track, after a four hour test. After 24 minutes we learn that the crew has left the studio after nine hours filming, whilst work on the guitar tracks continued for some hours.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/6/2/1/8/0/1062180-single-a-record-is-being-produced-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=7458e80bb9"},{"name":"Come Home Swallow","tagline":"","description":"During the Cultural Revolution, Xie Zhixin (Yuan Yue) learns that his son Xie Feng (Ma Xiaowei)'s lover Ulan (Zhang Xiaolei) is the daughter of his student, Lu Yan (Gao Ying), from many years ago.

Processual Video is minimal with regards to an image but quite complex in terms of the interplay of language and image. In fact, the image as such functions more as a tracking device. On a black screen, a white line slowly rotates on its own axis, seemingly generating a spoken text that refers to itself. Depending on its position, the line gets narrower, then wider, finally dissipating horizontally into thin white strokes.

The fence ended up having a destructive significance for an identity that otherwise knows no boundaries. Through archive footage and touching portraits, we are shown a warm and, at times, tragicomic look at a new everyday life for both Danes and Germans, where old friends have to meet on either side of the fence.

Sulian had been waiting faithfully for her boyfriend who tragically died in a foreign land. Long coveted by the local men, she was forcefully violated by them. The women of the town, unable to restrain their own husbands, instead slandered Sulian by calling her a promiscuous vixen. Ultimately, in a town with no legal protections, this beautiful woman was destroyed by jealousy and sin, and died as a victim. Since then, the towns collective malice became a secret never spoken of again in Yunwu. It wasnt until ten years later, when men began to die violently at their weddings or while taking concubines, always with a bride doll appearing at the scene, that the name Sulian was mentioned again. The curse of the doll bride left the villagers in constant fear and unrest.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/5/7/4/6/2/1157462--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=5c61e0c3af"},{"name":"Havana's Sky","tagline":"","description":"2021.
