Lewis and producer Elizabeth Taylor-Mead have constructed their argument well, but it is Jonathan Dimbleby's brief comments towards the end that contain the crucial lesson: forty years on, the same forces work to distort our view of Northern Ireland. The film only indicates this to be the case, but it is precise and coherent enough to make the point with considerable force.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"This Little Bullet","tagline":"","description":"This gun safety film starring John Wayne is just as timely and appropriate today as when it was first shown almost 40 years ago.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Sexuella","tagline":"","description":"Sex comedy based on a novel by Jacques Chaumelle and the director.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/0/9/4/9/4/409494-sexuella-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=ae8f0c0957"},{"name":"That Feeling","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/8/7/2/4/4/887244-that-feeling-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=e237ec0c24"},{"name":"Anxiety","tagline":"","description":"Amir is the accountant of a company that is falsely accused of embezzlement, and before his arrest, he kills the chief accountant who is the main culprit...","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/6/6/2/0/7/666207-anxiety-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=7f77f14dba"},{"name":"Operation Black September","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/7/0/3/3/5/270335-operation-black-september-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=1f35026e88"},{"name":"Matchfit","tagline":"","description":"A grumpy Scottish soccer boss meets a young fan in a TB sanatorium.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/5/9/9/4/7/459947-matchfit-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=2e06d195c0"},{"name":"Without Father","tagline":"","description":"After the death of her husband, Tamara gave her daughter Olya to an orphanage and left for the North.

The film re-digitises footage shot in Iceland and northern Sweden from Juliens film True North, a work based on the story of African-American explorer Matthew Henson, one of the key members of Robert E. Peary's 1909 Arctic expedition, and arguably the first individual to reach the North Pole. In Encore II (Radioactive), the protagonist is recast as a cyborg played by Vanessa Myrie. Using super-8 footage from Juliens earlier video experiments which were shot in 1980, whilst he was studying at St. Martins School of Art, the film manipulates the Icelandic landscape and its surroundings, imbuing them with a visual and sonic electronic aura that dislocates the setting from a specific time and place.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"L-haut","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/1/2/1/0/111210-la-haut-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=d66744f738"},{"name":"Ligeia","tagline":"","description":"Thrillers, Erotic Thrillers, Indie Suspense & Thriller - Director Dave Lawler updates an Edgar Allan Poe story for the modern world by examining what happens when a man, Kieran, is unable to get over the death of his first wife, Ligeia, even as his new spouse, Rowena, begs for his attention.

In this rarely-seen TV pilot, the Kid and Pepe intercede on behalf of the murdered rancher's daughter, openly defying the landgrabbers in a cow town so lawless that rustlers operate in broad daylight! Shot at the Corrigan Ranch in 1950, TEXAS KID co-starred Mercury Records recording artist John Laurenz as Pepe and stuntman Hugh Hooker as the Kid. Hooker, a specialist in stunts involving horses and stagecoaches, often doubled Gene Autry and even produced a few movies, including the low-budget gem . That movie's star was Hugh's teenage son Buddy Joe Hooker, whose own subsequent, stellar stunt career inspired HOOPER (1978), Burt Reynolds' hit comedy tribute to movie stuntmen.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/9/1/7/5/6/391756-adventures-of-the-texas-kid-border-ambush-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=7ff3f35093"},{"name":"Texas Bad Man","tagline":"Outlaw father against his sheriff son . . . in a gun fury story of the lawless west!","description":"Wayne Morris' B-western series was the last of its kind to be produced in Hollywood.

The place itself is a character in the film, as are the filmmaker's methods. The film is composed of multiple media: 16mm film, HD video, infrared stills, inter-titles, and sound recordings. The result is a feminist ethnographic landscape film that communicates both the majesty of 1800s landscape photography and the violence of a settler colonial gaze that is its context.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Dr. Bezbaruah 2","tagline":"","description":"Shantanu finally agrees to return to his birthplace Assam after seven long years to attend his sister's wedding but his fate welcomes him with some odd surprises.
