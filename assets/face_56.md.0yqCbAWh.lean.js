Later, the British aircraft industry amazed the world again with the Harrier, the first operational fighter jet that could take off and land upright, providing vital services to the troops on the ground.  This program explores the development of some of the most controversial fighter jet designs in British history: the Vampire, the Hunter, the Lightning and the Buccaneer. Of course, more recent successes such as the Jaguar, the Harrier and the Tornado are also discussed in detail, and the future is aptly depicted with an introduction to the brand new Eurofighter Typhoon.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/1/8/7/2/5/1118725-great-british-jets-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=07f5261d4f"},{"name":"Hand Over Arms, Not Harm","tagline":"","description":"Chinese movie","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/7/5/0/6/6/1075066-hand-over-arms-not-harm-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=50d208d573"},{"name":"Hunting","tagline":"","description":"The story is about the unexpected end of a bear hunt, about two unsuccessful hunters and about a scary caveman.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"James Andersen: Over 50 Years of Taking Pictures","tagline":"","description":"James Andersen: Over 50 Years of Taking Pictures is a culmination of photos, films that are brought to life with Andersen's own words.

Later models had as many as 13 machine guns, which protruded from the hull on all sides. In practice, as so often happens, little remained of the pre-war ideas. Because not all pilots were equally skilled, the formations often fell apart, after which Luftwaffe fighters shot the stragglers out of the sky one by one.  This program shows rare color images of the design stage and construction of the B-17 and, through archive images, provides an extensive report of the mighty Boeing's operations over war-torn Europe. A prominent role is also reserved for the beloved Sally B, one of the last flying B-17s and the star attraction of many air shows.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/1/8/7/1/6/1118716-ultimate-history-of-the-boeing-b17-bomber-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=b942964764"},{"name":"r l?gum","tagline":"","description":"No plot found","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"ti  myri","tagline":"","description":"No description found","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Vandrovali hudci","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Vida en la comuna Carlos Marx","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/2/2/0/4/7/1122047-vida-en-la-comuna-carlos-marx-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=48406259ba"},{"name":"Vinyl Heaven","tagline":"Gamle plader i nye tider","description":"The film goes behind the counter in Copenhagen's used record shops and hears about the rare jazz, soul and rock vinyl records, which are necessary to preserve the great cultural heritage that has never been reissued on CD, and about the musical aha experiences and obscure acquaintances, which results from the hunt.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/0/4/4/2/1/1104421-vinyl-heaven-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=f6e7ce3d15"},{"name":"Why We Came","tagline":"","description":"Landscapes contemplation makes the time perceptible.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/2/5/5/4/0/1025540-why-we-came-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=e6fed85b8d"},{"name":"Xin Tang Bo Hu","tagline":"","description":"Hong kong movie","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/4/7/9/9/0/1147990-xin-tang-bo-hu-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=c21e499679"},{"name":"Zajatci ?blova ch?tnu","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"ڧݧݧ֧ӧ ","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/0/5/9/2/0/805920---0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=5fe45f60e1"},{"name":"? ?","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/6/3/6/4/5/1063645--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=1de44978a3"},{"name":"","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/7/7/9/8/8/1177988--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=b06c4dd57f"},{"name":"Ů","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/6/8/9/7/9/1168979--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=895effeb12"},{"name":"ů","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/4/5/8/8/9/1145889--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=5640b49124"},{"name":"ϱ","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/2/5/4/3/3/825433--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=d4fd8ba589"},{"name":"ˤ","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/2/5/4/2/8/825428--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=fd657191f0"},{"name":" ݳ 2005","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"ˮͯ","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/1/5/6/4/3/1115643--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=a951f8d1ff"},{"name":"","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/6/1/5/1/7/1161517--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=718d0c8032"},{"name":"","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/7/8/3/9/7/1178397--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=0fe04b9e85"},{"name":"Ѫ","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/7/8/4/2/7/1178427--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=e46fb7532c"},{"name":"ع","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/4/3/7/2/5/243725--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=714749a448"},{"name":"","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/7/8/0/8/5/1178085--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=3f23b22d67"},{"name":"Ahmet Glbay first session","tagline":"","description":"Concert recorded live at the Jazz Caf-Chez Papa former Bistingo in Saint Germain des Prs plus interviews","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/2/8/0/9/8/828098-ahmet-gulbay-first-session-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=2046086f62"},{"name":"Le Tombeau d'Aphrodite (Version 5)","tagline":"","description":"Starting from waste from the pornographic film industry of the seventies of the last century which I first sent to rot in a basin of water before passing the film through a Truca-JK type optical printer.

Black bears have been known to prey on moose and dear calves but their main diet consists of much smaller fare. With up to 800 pounds of bulk to support, black bears need to feed constantly to survive and to do so they have evolved one of the most omnivorous diets on the planet. You name it, they eat it!This film follows the early cycle of the black bear's life; its hunting strategies, territorial behaviours, mating habits and feeding opportunities.The program will also explore the bear's troubled relationship with humans.

The interaction of the characters on stage is absolutely independent of the author's remarks. Thus, Mirzoev visibly shades the intimate, to some extent Freudian motifs he saw in the play.

In true Le Mans style, inspired driving ensured the 24-Hours was anything but dull with breakdowns and crashes adding to the already intense action. And with only 40 seconds separating the first two cars, the entertainment went right to the finish.  A late charge from Audi Sport UK Team Veloqx's Johnny Herbert ensured a nail-biting finale to an already action packed race. But in the end it was Audi Sport Team Gohs Seiji Ara who took the chequered flag. This win for Team Goh gave co-driver Tom Kristensen his 5th consecutive victory and record-equalling sixth title overall.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"?

Diaz Moraless video is an allegory, telling the story of one man, a parachutist, as a metaphor for the plight of those unemployed.

Each morning, the voiceover tells us, the parachutist wakes up, finds the taps at his sink do not work so washes his face in bath water and summons the courage to attempt another jump. These jumps are made from the national monument of Jakarta, Monas, an obelisk topped with a gold flame, which was built in the 1960s and 70s to symbolize Indonesias independence.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Q nal?.

The Tibetan landscape began to acquire a new face. Even Lhasa, the place of the gods, has changed beyond recognition, but the words of the Buddha, translated long ago into Tibetan, have preserved their message to this day: the path to liberation begins in each of us, and each of us has the prerequisites for achieving lasting happiness.
