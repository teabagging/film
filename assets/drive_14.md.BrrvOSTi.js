From this footage the following pictures were subsequently edited by other hands: Thunder Over Mexico (1933), Eisenstein in Mexico (1933), Death Day (1934), Time in the Sun (1940), and Que Viva Mexico (1979).","rating":"3.63","theme":"Monsters, aliens, sci-fi and the apocalypse","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/4/3/0/6/8/543068-que-viva-mexico--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=f1852c1187"},{"name":"Street Fighter: Assassin's Fist","tagline":"","description":"A multi-layered series that looks back to the formative years of Ryu and Ken as they live a traditional warrior's life in secluded Japan.","rating":"3.15","theme":"Epic heroes","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/5/9/3/8/5/259385-street-fighter-assassin-s-fist-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=ddb541800a"},{"name":"The Virgin Queen","tagline":"CinemaScope spectacularly spreads before you the velvet cape and violent age of Sir Walter Raleigh and The Virgin Queen.","description":"Sir Walter Raleigh overcomes court intrigue to win favor with the Queen in order to get financing for a proposed voyage to the New World.","rating":"3.22","theme":"Sci-fi horror, creatures, and aliens","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/1/8/2/1/21821-the-virgin-queen-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=536299ea49"},{"name":"Peep World","tagline":"","description":"On the day of their Father's 70th birthday party, four siblings come to terms with the publication of a novel written by the youngest sibling, that exposes the family's most intimate secrets.","rating":"2.85","theme":"Thought-provoking sci-fi action and future technology","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/5/2/3/10523-peep-world-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=66c2c5a2d4"},{"name":"Dark and Stormy Night","tagline":"In a House, Everyone Can Hear You Scream","description":"In the 1930s the family of old Sinas Cavinder, gathered for the reading of his will, find themselves being murdered by a mysterious phantom while two rival reporters compete for the story.","rating":"3.45","theme":"Bloody vampire horror","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/8/8/1/8/18818-dark-and-stormy-night-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=4ad9c8c9d5"},{"name":"Child in the Night","tagline":"The secret of a grisly murder, locked in a child's mind.","description":"Traumatized after seeing his father brutally murdered by a hook wielding assailant, young Luke is tasked to help unmask the killer.","rating":"3.02","theme":"Twisted dark psychological thriller","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/5/0/5/8/105058-child-in-the-night-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=bbf157da4e"},{"name":"Desperate Journey","tagline":"Man alive, Just picture this excitement!","description":"During WWII, when an allied bomber is shot down over Germany, the five surviving crew are captured but cleverly escape detention after learning German secret information and knocking out a Nazi major.
