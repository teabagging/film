An irascible and violent brute, Frank neglects his wife to the point of pushing her into the arms of one of their neighbors. Their teenage daughter does not know how to free herself from the annoying advances of the young people of the neighborhood. As the drama of their existence gradually appears to take on the proportions of a tragic epic, Weill contrasts his story by portraying the total indifference of the outside world to these trivial and insignificant lives.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/4/5/6/4/6/645646-weill-street-scene-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=a8a85fe6b6"},{"name":"The River","tagline":"first images of mine","description":"Two kids, a party, a river and a videocam","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/8/5/9/3/1/585931-el-rio-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=cfefcff8a8"},{"name":"Alex","tagline":"","description":"A short film about absent parenting and the isolation of non-binary youth.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/6/4/7/7/8/864778-alex-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=e15b9d3397"},{"name":"Jeanfi Janssens - Dcolle","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/9/3/3/0/7/593307-jeanfi-janssens-decolle-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=5e02cf986d"},{"name":"Noraebang: Hot Women 2","tagline":"","description":"The special secret to a successful noraebang is revealed!

Had he reached the White House, he would have been able to reopen the investigation into his brothers death five years earlier, and it is known from numerous testimonies that he intended to do so. Neither Johns nor Roberts death are elucidated; both investigations, conducted under Lyndon Johnsons watch, are widely regarded as cover-ups. In each case, the official conclusion is rife with contradictions. This film sums them up. But it does more: it shows that the key to solving both cases resides in the link between them. And it solves them beyond a reasonable doubt.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/2/2/1/5/2/822152-israel-and-the-assassinations-of-the-kennedy-brothers-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=890398dcb5"},{"name":"Made of Shit and Sticks","tagline":"","description":"Music video for the song by Loqiemean.

Fragments of survivor testimonials mix with archival photographs and objects, along with present-day city celebrations (what is being forgotten in these civic rites of memory?). Haunted natural scapes grow over the dead, the abandoned graveyards and stones mark the places where culture and community used to be performed. This is a synoptic act of grieving, but also: a summoning of the present, a conjuring of the thousand ways that the betrayals of neighbours and friends marked out the Jews who had lived peaceably amongst them for generations, newly caught now in a terror of state oppression and greed.\\"- Mike Hoolboom","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/9/2/7/9/3/692793-not-moldova-1937-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=5961e32ea4"},{"name":"2 Glasses of Milk","tagline":"Two writers.

According to most sources, Cuban civil society is limited to the opposition, which has little impact on the Cuban political scenario. Regardless, yearly, the U.S. government allocates tens of millions of taxpayer money to empower dissidents in the island. By doing so, it overlooks genuine expressions of pluralism, reform and contestation which are shaping the Cuban public sphere, sometimes in autonomous ways, sometimes within State-run institutions. Through in-depth interviews to members of Cuban Civil society, this documentary explores the complexities associated to these processes, following the itinerary of the debate about the concept of civil society generated in Cuba, since the 90s to the present.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/7/1/2/4/2/571242-rethinking-cuban-civil-society-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=440f6b8607"},{"name":"A slower speed of light","tagline":"","description":"Light is interrupted by a strip of old 16mm film seen under a low magnification microscope and is reflected from the surface in rainbow colours.
