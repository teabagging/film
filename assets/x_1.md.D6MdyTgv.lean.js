The result of decades of obsessive recording, his Atlas of Men contained standardized pictures of 1200 individuals, obvious animation fodder. Attending to fundamental cinematic concepts of cut, shot and motion, I employed a computer to reduce Sheldon's three dimensions to the one of time. Further programs turned the coordinates of bodily form into notes, giving endomorphy, ectomorphy and mesomorphy each their own voice. Thus each point in Sheldon's parameter space implies a type of human and, by my contrivance, a frame of film and a musical chord.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"ͺ","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/5/3/5/1/6/853516--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=aec44d2d57"},{"name":"ް޿","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/5/3/1/5/0/853150--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=9562e44375"},{"name":"Caceria Mortal","tagline":"","description":"The suicide of a young convict triggers a series of bloody deaths for everyone involved with his apprehension and conviction.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/5/1/4/9/8/751498-caceria-mortal-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=95868f5838"},{"name":"Documentary filmmaking: Christoph Hbner talks with Volker Koepp","tagline":"","description":"Interview with Volker Koepp about his filmmaking practice conducted and directed by Christoph Hbner","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"98 Thompson","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/3/8/4/2/4/1138424-98-thompson-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=c9b0a53cca"},{"name":"Prostitution 7","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/2/3/2/8/5/923285--7-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=fe8d30ac13"},{"name":"Spur eines Zweifels","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Les gagneurs","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/1/1/4/6/5/211465-les-gagneurs-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=b0168cd9a2"},{"name":"Hatulan: Bilibid Boys 2","tagline":"","description":"Hatulan: Bilibid Boys 2: Directed by Deo Fajardo Jr..

The last one was shot in a gentle rain and the rainfall 'plucked' the windharps as it fell, while I filmed a fisherman preparing his boat. The middle section of this film was shot in a small fishing village Port Kerwin , about 60 miles south of St. John's, at the studio of artist Don Wright. Here, I amplified pine trees, set up windharps and recorded the gulls overlooking a bay beneath me.

A constant dialog between man and spirits is carried on through various communicative media, including invocations, dreams, and music. As this film beautifully reveals, there is a wealth of musical tradition in Lake Chambri: carved wooden drums whose lively vibrations are said to shake loose ripened fruits for harvest; pairs of sacred bamboo flutes used in boys' initiations and concealed from women; orchestras of flutes identified with dogs or turkeys; flutes captured in warfare used with dance masks to invoke fish; and the panpipe with its melodies of mourning.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Performance [studio]","tagline":"","description":"Two versions of this performance are documented in the collection of the Netherlands Media Art Institute.

The festival filmed here emphasises the status of women and placated their potentially dangerous mystic powers. The commentary emphasises that the annual Gelede festival serves a cathartic role by paying respect to women in a patriarchal society. During the course of the festival social tensions are brought out into the open and ridiculed; antagonism between the sexes is thus controlled and given a legitimate outlet. The film shows the preparation of masks and the climax of the festival in which the Great Mask appears at midnight. On the following day the lesser masks entertain, satirising the movements of women.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"?ntikam Mele?i","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/8/0/2/9/2/1080292-intikam-melegi-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=6314acb0cb"},{"name":"It All Comes Out in the End","tagline":"","description":"The story of friends who prove that there are no secrets between them.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/6/9/2/5/1/1069251-it-all-comes-out-in-the-end-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=9018b37bfd"},{"name":"Lassie - The Road Back","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/4/5/9/6/9/1045969-lassie-the-road-back-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=2e2dc98f14"},{"name":"Luiz Gonzaga, o Rei do Bai?o","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Priya","tagline":"","description":"A young woman recounts her transformation, involving her parents, brother, sister-in-law, classmate, professor, and cycle waala who was in love with her.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/8/1/4/9/8/1081498-priya-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=5d8178480d"},{"name":"էڧӧڧ֧ݧߧ ٧ѧܧݧѧ","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/6/7/9/3/1/567931---0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=7efeb357ba"},{"name":"Mur - Bur","tagline":"","description":"A documentary about a music school based on finding the rhythmic quality in every child, focused on the visual and auditory rhythm of childrens movements.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/6/2/4/2/7/1062427-mur-bur-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=148225509e"},{"name":"Brother Wang and Brother Liu Walk Hades","tagline":"","description":"Brother Wang and Brother Liu Walk Hades","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Moon","tagline":"","description":"The action takes place during the revolution in Russia.
