The Roman governor, Pontius Pilate, who was prepared to set Christ free, gave in to the mobs demands and ordered his crucifixion. In case there were any lingering doubts about the Romans innocence, the Bible provides the compelling image of Pilate washing his hands C symbolically absolving himself of Jesus death. But how accurate are the accounts in the Gospels? Does this portrait of a weak-willed Pilate stand up to historical scrutiny?

After 15 years in the making, The Limits of What We Know documents the changing landscape of Zimbabwe and its peoples relationship to it.  Quietly told through the voices of Zimbabweans and arranged through chapters such as The Great Zimbabwe Monument ,The Composition of Drought, The Language of Trees, Rain, Clay, the film is part travelogue, part environmental study and part meditation on life itself. Exploring a range of topics from the function of weeds and the hearts of giraffes, to the construction of dams and the rise and fall of kingdoms, the film ultimately reveals natures mysterious tenacity in the face of great change. While The Limits of What We Know appears at first to be a portrait of Zimbabwe, it culminates as a heart-felt picture of our changing world as it struggles to compensate for the ever-increasing dominance of the human race.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/2/0/3/8/3/620383-the-limits-of-what-we-know-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=806217733e"},{"name":"This is the Photo","tagline":"","description":"Hctor Castagnetto da Rosa was arrested on 17 August 1971 and then disappeared.

The result is not only a CD but also a DVD, both called The Power Of Nature. That very day in Munich the rain poured down, but the fans couldnt care less. Darren Wharton and his band members were on stage and the only thing that mattered was the intensity of the songs. No one better knows how to write a decent song than Darren and as to the audience: it was all meat and drink to them.

We, in the West, have begun to consider ourselves too civilized to fight. We fight with words and on the off chance that something does go wrong, a trauma team is at hand. Nevertheless, people continue to have a need to fight; take the violence during soccer matches. But in fact, we don't know how to handle aggression. In this film, several approaches to the martial arts in the West and the East are highlighted. The essence of the film is philosophical, but disguised as fight.

Within Dr. Bukhanovsky's clinic, we encounter three of his young patients: Edward and Igor, whose families express deep concerns about their disturbing fantasies, and 'Mischa', who has perpetrated acts of torture and sexual assault. Dr. Bukhanovsky's approach is groundbreaking, offering treatment to potential serial offenders.

It also appears that pyrotechnics are closely linked to exorcism from the danger of volcanic eruptions: the firework free from the presence of evil spirits, which popular belief evokes in volcanic areas. Il Fuoco di Napoli traces the story of a man, Giuseppe Scudo, and his passion, the fireworks. His art and his life are one for him.

We see shooting parties, garden parties and her husband on his prized English thoroughbred, as well as farm labourers doing the back-breaking manual work that kept the property operating. Forgacs then introduces footage of the woman shot in the 1990s. She walks gingerly around the property, which is now uninhabited and overgrown.
