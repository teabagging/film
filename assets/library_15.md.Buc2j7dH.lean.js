Perhaps because it was prophetic, or because Wildbolz sensed his fate and truly identified with Ricco, the life of the artist is related with a captivating poignancy, from his privileged but troubled childhood in Germany, to his artistic triumphs in Bern, to his career-wrecking imprisonment on the charge of immorality, ending with his life-draining illness in France. Wildbolz portrays Ricco as a victim throughout, a man misunderstood by bourgeois society and despised for his pursuit of exotic experiences (which, by the way, included an obsession with naked boys).","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/3/6/1/8/0/436180-ricco-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=43e0343e6f"},{"name":"Kimini horeteru","tagline":"","description":"Shogo is a street musician who doesn't sell well.

Critics complained about the substandard photography in Il Sogno di Butterfly, but this might have been due to poor laboratory work.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/4/3/9/3/6/243936-the-dream-of-butterfly-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=bf9e60e926"}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:I},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:H,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},L={class:"card-container"},W=["disabled"],R={key:0},P={key:1};function E(s,i,t,c,h,o){const m=f("PoemCard");return a(),n("section",null,[i[1]||(i[1]=e("div",{class:"top-banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[e("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎬 Movie Showcase 🥳")])],-1)),e("div",L,[(a(!0),n(u,null,b(o.visiblePoems,(l,p)=>(a(),y(m,{key:p,poem:l},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),o.hasMorePoems?(a(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:h.isLoading,onClick:i[0]||(i[0]=(...l)=>o.loadMore&&o.loadMore(...l))},[h.isLoading?(a(),n("span",P,"Loading...")):(a(),n("span",R,"See more"))],8,W)):w("",!0)])}const F=d(D,[["render",E],["__scopeId","data-v-69f33d1e"]]),O=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/15.md","filePath":"library/15.md"}'),G={name:"library/15.md"},J=Object.assign(G,{setup(s){return(i,t)=>(a(),n("div",null,[v(F)]))}});export{O as __pageData,J as default};
