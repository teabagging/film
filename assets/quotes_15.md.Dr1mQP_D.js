Driving forward with a self-assured camp, Berta Boys looks to open up this imagery by creating an isolated world where men turn their violent gaze on each other. Terrence is joined in the film by fellow Albertan artists Aaron Brown and Gabriel Esteban Molina as co-writers and co-performers. In an effort to explore the masculine archetypes found within themselves, the trio meditate on the unrestricted behaviours that blend tragedy with absurdity.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/9/2/3/9/1/792391-berta-boys-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=4c6e2bf78a"},{"name":"Holwerd at Sea","tagline":"","description":"Lots of villages in the Frisian area of the Wadden Sea have to deal with population decline.

Some academics are warning that popular churches who take a firm line on issues like gay marriage, abortion and euthanasia are pushing Christianity farther away from the attitudes of mainstream society. Others believe that the fervour of charismatic faith is attracting large numbers, but ignoring a quiet exodus out of the back door. Robert Beckford speaks to church leaders in the UK, including the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, about how they see the future.  This revealing film gets to the heart of whats changing within Christianity in the UK. It will show how the faithful are kicking back against the steady decline in church attendance, and provide evidence of a more committed, but potentially divided, future.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/2/4/9/7/3/324973-the-battle-for-christianity-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=2af6fb54cf"},{"name":"Grassroots to Bluegrass: Day One (Vol. 2)","tagline":"","description":"Trace the history of bluegrass as told by the women and men who play the music with their hearts in this second of two volumes of concert footage.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/5/9/7/0/5/959705-grassroots-to-bluegrass-day-one-vol-2--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=1eae3c31f6"},{"name":"Frau Pfarrer & Herr Priester","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/6/8/0/2/0/368020-frau-pfarrer-herr-priester-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=40ce852d93"},{"name":"Victory Song","tagline":"","description":"Consisting of found footage of an old Russian Soviet propaganda film ӧ֧ܧڧ  ܧ֧ ҧ֧է塱, being remade in author's handmade technique, work reflects on memory as a phenomenon which emphasizes the 'unwanted memory 'role in shaping social consciousness of today's society.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/0/8/7/8/1/608781-victory-song-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=a149dd7abb"},{"name":"H?vn","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/3/2/4/3/9/1132439-hvn-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=0cc5b791c3"},{"name":"Claudio Abbado: The Last Concert","tagline":"","description":"This was recorded over three nights at the Philharmonie in Berlin.
