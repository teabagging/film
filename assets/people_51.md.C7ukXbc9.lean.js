It details the mission of the ice-breaker Krasin to rescue the crashed crew of Umberto Nobile's arctic airship Italia. The raw material shot without any plan by cameramen who accompanied Krasin was used by Georgi and Sergei Vasilyev to create a coherent and powerful narrative in the tradition of Soviet montage school. Heroic Deed was released in October 1928 and its success helped Georgi and Sergei Vasilyev to realize their ambition to direct.

They gained notoriety with a loyal following in the Boston music scene, and beyond. The quartet was no different than any other talentless, self-deprecating, beer-swilling, girl-chasing lunkheads with guitars. It wasn't about money. Catching a girl's eye, a free round of drinks, or simply completing a song in unison were their rewards. Fans and fellow bands in Massachusetts look fondly on the decades of positive ripple effects their presence (still to this day) has on the local music scene. This documentary is a labor of love by family and friends, crafted as a tribute to the Dogmatics' late co-founder and bassist Paul O'Halloran. See how the band came into being in the early 1980s, rising out of a pocket of musical talent in the South Shore area near Boston.

In its half-sung, poetic monologue, the Sun directs its lover, a human - and in an unsettling manner, presents a gloomy vision of a collapsing world, where the only lasting and immutable elements are the words and language. The Suns speech is a juggle of styles and moods: it goes from the elevated and emotionally-charged confessions to the goofy stand-up comedy, and ends up with an interpretation of ?I got love, a song from the 1970 musical Purlie. The general ambiance of the film is dark, but the sung monologue leaves a space for hope and marks the significance of words as tools of social responsibility.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/1/2/8/5/9/1012859-the-new-sun-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=99cf711275"},{"name":"White Trash","tagline":"","description":"The gulls on the junkyard are feeding on human trash.

For the 2003 broadcast version of Life  which aired as part of the 'The Weight of Time' series on Chinese TV  Gao did not participate, thus this film is only about the desert family, headed by father Liu Zeyuan. Since 1989, Kang has remained in contact with the family and returned to film them multiple times over the years. Kang's filmmaking largely consists of striking landscape shots of the desert and rather tortured interviews with reticent family members, who often provide one-word answers to Kangs audible questions. Kang himself also appears, and is an important catalyst to drawing out responses.

But Jacqueline is pretty and very tempting, so the Machiavellian Monsieur Masure concocts a whole affabulation to confuse Jacqueline and her lover - by telephone - and then make the latter believe that this famous artificial sleep was not such as to have prevented her from receiving the tributes that he, Masure, was delighted to lavish on her.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/9/0/8/7/2/490872-reveille-toi-cherie-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=6fdc5e92a8"},{"name":"Shin Jinsei Gekijo","tagline":"","description":"1961 Theater of Life adaptation.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/3/1/8/3/4/631834-shin-jinsei-gekijo-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=0ef8b6a01d"},{"name":"Moslems in Britain: Cardiff","tagline":"","description":"Part of BFI collection \\"Portrait of a People.\\"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/9/1/3/4/9/291349-moslems-in-britain-cardiff-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=c89d5e73f1"},{"name":"The Ambassadress","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/1/4/0/6/3/214063-the-ambassadress-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=27e0762492"},{"name":"Adutha Veettu Penn","tagline":"","description":"Mannaru falls in love with his neighbour, Leela, who is a skilled dancer and singer.
