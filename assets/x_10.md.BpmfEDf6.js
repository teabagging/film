The ensuing tour spawned the live album, Hell Freezes Over, which debuted at number one on the Billboard album chart. It included four new studio songs, with 'Get Over It' and 'Love Will Keep Us Alive' both becoming Top 40 hits. The album - for which the live tracks were recorded at an MTV Special on April 24, 1994 - proved as successful as the tour, selling six million copies in the U.S. The following night - April 25, 1994 - the Eagles returned to Warner Brothers Studios in Burbank, CA, where they had recorded the previous night, and a second show was filmed and indeed transmitted on television. For the first time on vinyl, this release features this relaxed and quite extraordinary event in its entirety. Captured across two installments, this delightful and rare performance will prove a must have item for Eagles fans everywhere.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/9/4/1/0/5/1094105-the-eagles-unplugged-1994-the-second-night--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=eb4c65502b"},{"name":"Ӱ","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/3/4/7/3/9/1134739--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=80278659f3"},{"name":"Hildegard","tagline":"","description":"An abbess, visionary, naturalist, playwright and composer, Hildegard of Bingen (played by Patricia Routledge) was a remarkable woman of the Middle Ages, her legacy comprising some of the most radiant accounts of religious experience ever.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/7/2/0/3/8/1172038-hildegard-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=5d15276969"},{"name":"411VM: Issue 7","tagline":"","description":"Skaters  Bam Margera, Chad Fernandez, Fred Gall, George Nagai, Jamie Thomas, Lance Dawes, Mark Channer, Matt Reason  Soundtrack  Jamie Thomas Profiles C Blondie Call Me  Bam Margera Wheels Of Fortune C Rpm Food Of My Derhythm  Chad Fernandez George Nagai Wheels Of Fortune C DJ Takemura Harmonium  Woodward Skate Camp C Stiff Little Fingers Roots Radicals Rockers Reggae  Lance Dawes In Depth C Time And Space Time And Space Theme  Santa Rosa Skatepark Spot Check C Kurios Spell It With J  Sweden South Africa Australia Uk World Report C Coolio Sticky Fingers  Switchstance Switchstance C Moist Push  Screaming Squeegees Private Property C Wizards Of Ooze The Bone  Gp Skatepark Spot Check C Galliano Better All The Time  Transitions Transitions C Sinister Dane Ugly Thing  credits C House Of Pain Where Im From","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/7/3/4/7/9/873479-411vm-issue-7-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=ba9bd76771"},{"name":"Electric Blue Special: Big Ones","tagline":"","description":"Busty wenches display their wares for all to see and admire.

Adhering to the original Orthodox Christian dogma and rituals introduced to ancient Rus (present-day Ukraine, Byelorussia and Russia) by the Greeks of Byzantium, the Old Believers see themselves as the last Christians left on the face of the Earth. Here in North America, for the first time in their history, they are threatened not by persecution, but by economic bounty and the western notion of personal freedom. Shot over the four seasons, the film is both a beautiful rendering of timeless rituals and a fascinating exploration of the Old Believers' turbulent history.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Poovukkul Boogambam","tagline":"","description":"Film starring Saroja Devi B. and Thiagarajan","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Secrets of the Unknown: Witches","tagline":"","description":"Witches explores the long and clandestine history of this misunderstood group of people.
