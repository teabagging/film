The mask then has a double function: to protect against the virus and to silence. Similarly imposed isolation and enclosure as the only possible defense against the enemy works. The vulnerability of women in Argentina has not been modified by isolation. For those in situations of violence, this means to be in constant contact with the real enemy with no way of escape. In this context what is supposed to protect them works against them, and makes the mask worthless.

The lines that you can see were made in the physical world using marker pens and paper. The resulting line drawings were then documented and filmed where the camera moved across the drawn paper. Now existing digitally, the drawings were then layered over one another and green screen processes were applied to create arresting tensions between the lines.

However, one watches this suite unfold into a delicate investigation of the limits of technology, and the potential those limits enable. Through the use of preset wipes and crude RGB color palettes, Stratford uncovers hidden potential in what otherwise would be considered a long-outmoded device for creative expression. In doing so, the typical subversive gesture of using obsolete technology that occurs within contemporary art is supplanted by an earnest exploration into a crucial link between early video aesthetics and current technologically inflected imagery.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Terrifying Mobile Videos - Compilation - 33 Submissions from Phones","tagline":"","description":"This is a compilation of submitted videos featuring only psychic phenomena and frightening images taken with a \\"cell phone,\\" which anyone who has one can be a photographer.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/3/4/3/4/5/1134345-terrifying-mobile-videos-compilation-33-submissions-from-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=a6e001843d"},{"name":"In Between Waves","tagline":"","description":"Camille is eleven.
