It premiered at the Teatro San Benedetto in Venice on 22 May 1813. The music is characteristic of Rossini's style, remarkable for its fusion of sustained, manic energy with elegant, pristine melodies.  The plot, in brief: Isabellas lover Lindoro has been kidnapped, and in her search for him she is shipwrecked and taken captive by Mustafa, Bey of Algiers. To her amazement and delight, she finds Lindoro among the Beys prisoners. Isabella hatches a plot that involves flirtation and stealth, and together she and Lindoro escape.

No one imagined that within 14 years, the interval of peace and prosperity would be buried in the mud of the WWIs trenches.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/9/2/8/8/7/792887-paris-1900-the-city-of-lights-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=cfb39d12d2"},{"name":"Sunny Daze","tagline":"My name is Sunny.

His BBC talk show, So Graham Norton, is something that you just couldn't find in America: a rampant exercise in audience titillation that wallows gloriously in bizarre human behavior. It's like an audience-interactive NC-17 Saturday Night Live, with occasional breaks for celebrity chit-chat. If you ever wanted to see Gillian Anderson, Cher, Sophia Loren, or Dolly Parton break the talk-show mold with bawdy sex talk, then your dreams have come true. And Norton's cringe-inducing yet compulsively watchable audience polls, which ask common folk to relate embarrassing, adult-oriented tales, reveal a European openness (and sense of humor) that just wouldn't fly in the U.S.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/4/0/1/5/2/440152-the-best-of-so-graham-norton-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=7f36f31826"},{"name":"O Pasquim: A Subvers?o do Humor","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/9/1/4/1/4/391414-o-pasquim-a-subversao-do-humor-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=4bfe563b9f"},{"name":"New Model Army: Live 161203","tagline":"","description":"Recorded and filmed on 16th December 2003 at the Astoria, London and released in May 2004.
