All the great filmmakers were involved: Capra, Ford, Huston, and Hollywood's new master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock. After making several films advocating American entry into the war alongside the British, in direct violation of the Neutrality Act, Hitchcock took advantage of Zanuck's departure from 20th Century Fox to launch a major new propaganda project: Lifeboat. He asked John Steinbeck to write the basic story. This great American literary figure, author of The Grapes of Wrath, whose adaptation was one of Fox's biggest successes, was himself very committed to the war effort. When Lifeboat was released, success quickly turned to controversy. What if Hitchcock's film had completely missed the mark?
