The pieces centre around bittersweet comedy, bleak surrealism and experimental filmmaking and mark the third creative project from ChewBoy Productions. They deal with the facts that we may never find happiness in our lives or our work, and that ultimately, we always end up back where we started.  Before the screening, audiences were invited to answer a series of questions. We then put all the answers into our algorithm, creating a truly individual cut of the films which were representative of the room's overall worldview, perceptions, personality and feeling.

DisObey attempts to expand (and contract) definitions and interpretations of The Law. DisObey features Jason Warr, a criminologist from the University of Lincoln. Jason calls for a re-ordering of society: a recognition that we need to change our thinking and behavior radically in order to create a society that is truly fair and just for all.

The captains' stories tell a lot more than about life at sea. The narrative style is documentary in the classical sense: It is only the captains who speak, there is no voiceover. Their own words and the pictures let viewers gain a very close insight into the captains' lives. Hamburg, the German port known as \\"gate to the world\\", creates the cinematic parenthesis of this documentary. All captains portrayed have a close relation to Hamburg - they live or work there or come to Hamburg with their ships every now and then.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/1/0/1/2/8/1010128-kapitane-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=c2bcb99cc5"},{"name":"Ludwigstra?e - Der Kinofilm","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/1/6/4/2/0/1016420-ludwigstrae-der-kinofilm-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=7482c07125"},{"name":"Groenland, les derniers chasseurs des glaces","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/5/4/8/1/0/954810-groenland-les-derniers-chasseurs-des-glaces-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=23026f67e6"},{"name":"Collectif Mtiss - Olympia 2016","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/9/1/5/8/0/991580-collectif-metisse-olympia-2016-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=31bfacde44"},{"name":"Don't Forget to Remember Me","tagline":"A sisterhood that transcends place and time.","description":"\\"Don't Forget to Remember Me\\" is a story about two sisters in a small Chinese city.

From the serene courtyards of the University of Qarawiyyin to busling souk streets, from walled city of Fez to the mountainous sanctuary of Moulay Idris, the film shares the spiritual secrets of the places and their stories.  The beauty of the great city of Fez, founded by descendants of the Noble Prophet (May Allah swt shower blessings upon him), is shared by a visitor who is himself a direct descendant of that great household. The result is a moving meeting of two traditions that form the very core of great Islamic narrative.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/5/5/8/1/2/955812-fez-city-of-saints-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=802b53a621"},{"name":"Meinungsterror und Medienmanipulation","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/8/0/9/5/4/480954-meinungsterror-und-medienmanipulation-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=ef2a9a1e22"},{"name":"Chautauqua: An American Narrative","tagline":"","description":"Chautauqua: An American Narrative is a one-hour documentary that looks at the contemporary aspects of Chautauqua, the utopian community that is in Chautauqua, New York.

The double traumas of sexual persecution and combat may be why a 2008 RAND study found that female veterans are suffering twice as much depression and post-traumatic stress disorder as their male counterparts.Very few women have been willing to speak out, but four women, all in their twenties, and their families decided to talk openly about their ordeals.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"A Collection of Chemicals","tagline":"A very strange comedy about fathers, daughters, kidnappers and eggplant.","description":"Eccentric, bored recent widower Si Foster, a self-proclaimed eggplant connoisseur, is lonely.

When a fire gets out of control in a skyscraper it tests fire fighters to their limits. Predicting how a fire is behaving high up in a building is almost impossible.  The fire fighters who entered the Twin Towers on 11 September 2001 could only guess at what was happening almost 1000 feet above them. That fateful day brought about the death of 343 New York fire fighters.  Jose Torero believes fire fighters need not be put in such danger and that new technology could have saved many of the 343 fire fighters who died doing their duty that day. He believes he could even have saved the Twin Towers.  He has spent the last ten years developing a system that could change the way fires are fought forever. It's called Firegrid. It's a revolutionary approach to fire fighting that could save thousands of lives, giving man the upper hand on one of his oldest enemies.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/4/7/6/1/7/947617-skyscraper-fire-fighters-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=0924dd60b2"},{"name":"Udo Jrgens - Jetzt oder nie: Live","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/1/6/5/4/5/316545-udo-jurgens-jetzt-oder-nie-live-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=0581e2e571"},{"name":"Dogfood","tagline":"","description":"Chris and Raffi two 16 year olds rebelling boredom, decide to break into an elderly woman's house.

It is as if one of the characters temporarily borrows the space in the woman, in order to become image. Without any formal directions imposed upon her, the woman sculptures herself nine times from within herself. Unbearably fragile and incompatible with the will of our ego.
