Fillmaker Arianne Hinz handles all of these losses with the seriousness they deserve. The children place the event in context, against the background of the places where the loss is felt most keenly: a tent made from blankets and towels, the gym where the fencing matches are held and the stables where the deceased sisters favorite horse is kept. The children roam around in a dreamlike lost and found, looking for something that can illlustrate the sense of loss, that can fill the void or replace what is no more.

The centenary in 2013 of Brittens birth prompted this new Royal Opera production, in which director Richard Jones uses the setting of a celebratory pageant in 1953 to explore the works alternating splendour and intimacy. This theatrical, inventive and colourful staging has at its core the symbolic reflections between the Tudor Elizabethan and the New Elizabethan ages that characterize the opera.

The focus of the project are the two iconic East London streets of Cable Street and Brick Lane.  2011 marked the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Cable Street, the seminal event in local and labour movement history when the East Ends Jewish population came together with trade unionists and other groups to prevent Oswald Mosleys Black Shirts marching through their community. In the 1970s the predominantly Muslim Bangladeshi community living in and around Brick Lane was subjected to similar racist attacks by organised fascist groups.

The film includes footage shot at Anti-Readings, with time-lapse, double exposures, distorting lenses, and frenetic non-traditional camerawork evocative of the playfully chaotic spirit of the events.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/0/2/5/8/4/402584-loudmouth-collective-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=c8e931c570"},{"name":"Objectivo Bagdad","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/5/4/1/2/7/154127-objectivo-bagdad-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=32437c43f8"},{"name":"The Peeper's Story 2 - The Escape Partner","tagline":"","description":"plot is unknown","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/3/6/8/6/5/1036865-the-peeper-s-story-2-the-escape-partner-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=0676df3007"},{"name":"Ro de pasiones","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Rumeur, etc.","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Sneher Protidan","tagline":"","description":"Sneher Protidan is a 2003 Indian Bengali drama film released on 2003.

Remarkably, today their numbers have risen to 11,000. But there is now a new, deadly threat. Charging Back starts at the Pilansberg Game Reserve, where mysterious, unseen assailants were killing rhinos. Poachers could not be blamed, as the horns remained intact. Unexpectedly, the perpetrators prove to be relocated adolescent elephants, orphaned in culls. Lack of family structure has turned them into aggressive delinquents - a problem which conservation authorities now address by importing the steadying influence of older bulls. In astonishing scenes, the attackers are captured red-handed. Without the least provocation, elephants launch vicious assaults on unsuspecting rhinos.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/9/8/8/9/1/998891-charging-back-a-rhino-story-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=b93109dbb0"},{"name":"Cruzando el Rio Bravo: Frontera asesina","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"The Divine Comedy - A short Movie about a short Album about Love","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/8/3/9/6/8/1083968-the-divine-comedy-a-short-movie-about-a-short-album-abou-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=3d3263fa61"},{"name":"Grand Guignol","tagline":"","description":"Adaptation of four Grand Guignol tales.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/8/9/7/1/8/789718-grand-guignol-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=9e673cadad"},{"name":"Kapag Nasukol ang Asong Ulol","tagline":"","description":"Outstanding NARCOM agent Armand Disierto (Ian) comes home to his violence-ridden hometown ruled by Mayor Mario Gaton (Paquito), his uncle whom he has a feud with during his childhood.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/4/0/3/6/7/940367-kapag-nasukol-ang-asong-ulol-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=8f237e1e93"},{"name":"Killerkuscheltiere II","tagline":"","description":"Sequel to Killerkuscheltiere.
