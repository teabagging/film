The first clear glass, cristallo, was invented 15th century, and it was around this time that the glass delusion was first reported.

In Tonga and throughout much of Polynesia, bark cloth has deep symbolic and ceremonial use. At birth, babies are swaddled in it. At marriage, newlyweds line their wedding bed, and at death, the departed are buried wrapped in it. This documentary investigates the highly collaborative process of making ngatu and the organizations of women who carry on with the tradition. While the process continues to be passed on from generation to generation, there are signs of change as a cash economy begins to infiltrate Tongan life. Young people show less interest in such labor intensive endeavor in the face of the older generation's belief that this tradition will never die.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/6/0/1/3/0/860130-kuo-hina-e-hiapo-the-mulberry-is-white-and-ready-for-harv-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=8ed604f33a"},{"name":"La caricatura mexicana del siglo XIX","tagline":"","description":"Mexican feature film","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Love and Support","tagline":"Misery Hates Company","description":"A comic story of love bordering on insanity.

The Peppimenarti people began to convert this enormous tract of land into a cattle station. They brought in helicopters to muster the cattle that were already there, cattle so wild they easily escaped conventional muster by stockmen. They built yards, roads and houses and set up a store and a school. They also began to build up their ceremonial life.

It was performed here with full awareness that this may be one of the last times such a ceremony would be staged in the traditional way. The ceremony was prepared by the Mangatopi family of Snake Bay after the death of a 35-year old family member killed by his wife. The dead mans father, Geoffrey Mangatopi, and his family requested this film to be made as a public record of a disappearing tradition. Unique to the Tiwi people of Melville and Bathurst islands, the Pukumani ceremony was not only performed to safe-guard the passage of the dead person into the spirit world, but to re-affirm kinship relationships and traditional Tiwi culture.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/9/2/1/9/5/892195-mourning-for-mangatopi-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=3d3081b040"},{"name":"The Myth-Makers","tagline":"","description":"Eighteen years after the failure of the revolution and freedom fighting 1848-49, the politicians of Hungary preparing for a compromise with Austria try to make use of the symbol of the revolution, the figure of the poet Pet?fi Sndor, to their own advantage.
