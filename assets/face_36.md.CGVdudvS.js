Another piece of bread lands, some rubber baby dolls fall onto it, some brown slop, a blanket, denim jeans, some businessmen in suits, and more slop.

Following the split of his punk group Frantic Elevators, Hucknall formed Simply Red in 1984, with David Fryman (guitar), Tony Bowers (bass), Fritz McIntyre (keyboards and vocals), Tim Kellett (brass and live backing vocals) and Chris Joyce (drums). The group signed to Elektra Records in 1985 and released the album Picture Book in October that year. The single Holding Back the Years caused the album to go platinum and made the group one of the major successes of 1986. Since then, they have sold more than 50 million albums and in 2015 they announced the release of Big Love, their first studio album in eight years.

The film is primarily focused on the phenomenon of the cultural-natural landscape, of which man has been a part for a long time. He gradually reshaped it in his own image until its present form. Thanks to the approach of our ancestors, species-rich communities of flowery meadows and pastures, fields and grazing forests were created here. However, in recent centuries, our society and with it the country has undergone many changes.

Its narrative traces the history of capturing, preserving and reproducing acoustic signals, presenting material recorded on the early devices of E?douard-Le?on Scott de Martinville. Patented in 1857, the Phonautograph was an invention that transcribed sonic frequencies onto paper, from where they could be analyzed and studied graphically. For a long time people believed that the amount of information it stored was insufficient to recreate the actual sound, but in 2008 American sound engineers found a way to do just this. Through optically scanning the old phonautograms and playing them back at the correct speed, the voice of a man believed to be Scott de Martinville himself, could once again be heard. The words were recognized as lines from the French folk song Au Claire de la Lune, recorded in 1860, making it the oldest known recording of the human voice.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Play Hard","tagline":"Keep your eyes on the balls, because these guys are ready to 'Play Hard!'","description":"If you wanna 'Play Hard,' you better gear up: pads, jockstraps, socks and cleats have these guys ready for the ultimate body-contact sport.

Five decades of creative work intertwined with madness, jail time and violence, this film portrays a complex character. The manic depressive illness he suffered from trapped Kraus in a vicious cycle; each album recording ended in his hospitalization in a psychiatric hospital. Yet, his passion to create new music did not cease there. Kraus passed away unexpectedly in 2013 during the shooting of this film. He was 77. Combining archive footage with intimate interviews and scenes documented during a two year time span, the film unravels a different Kraus: human, tender, a weary warrior.

Mozart was twenty-six when he wrote this opera, which was commissioned by a Viennese Theatre and premiered in 1782. The production for the Schwetzingen Festival in May 1991, which was amusingly staged by Michael Hampe, was recorded in the small, jewel-like Rococo Palace Theatre.
