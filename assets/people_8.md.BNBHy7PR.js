The two hop a train to Marseilles, but it isn't long before Helene begins to think the robbery was a bad idea -- and isn't certain if her relationship with Paul is such a good thing either. Paul, however, isn't troubled by any second thoughts, and is very certain about his feelings for Helene -- so much so that he forces a priest to marry them at gunpoint. This is only the most recent manifestation of Paul's volatile personality, and rather than binding Helene closer to him, it only drives her farther away.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/5/6/4/9/5/256495-bandits-d-amour-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=5563b2c7b8"},{"name":"Fru Marianne","tagline":"","description":"Marianne is a spoiled young city woman who marries the farmer B?rje.

The film takes its inspiration from the Jerusalem Syndrome, a psychiatric syndrome, officially recognised in the 19th century, and from which the pilgrims and tourists that visited the Holy City suffered. A camera visits Jerusalem looking for a new approach to show the city. In parallel a young boy wanders the streets and discovers one night a prostitute with golden breasts. The boy, as does the camera, becomes a victim of a violently feminine Jerusalem.\\" - DAfilms","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/4/9/7/6/4/1049764-jerusalem-s-borderline-syndrome-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=f114a953a8"},{"name":"Jump-up: Caribbean Carnival in Canada","tagline":"","description":"A multicultural story that centres on the growing friendship of a newly-arrived West Indian child and a Canadian girl as they both discover how the black community organizes a yearly festival featuring costumes, music and a little history.

This is Denmarks most sold car. This houses worth has doubled over the last 3 years. A measuring tape and some hedges. So begins Max Kestners story on Denmark. With an even-keeled narrative, this film takes us on a kaleidoscope tour around Denmark from an editorial meeting at a magazine, to dictation in an Elementary school; from singing in a kindergarten, to a family planning their vacation; from a meeting with Pia Kj?rsgaard, to a real estate agent in front of a newly sold house and a Danish landscape seen from above. These everyday situations tell universal stories about us. These are contemporary stories. This is Denmarks world. With speed we shift through each story from up close to far away. This film is a mix of studio recordings with Denmark as its setting. This story is linear with a system of coordinates and a range of colors on repeat. Pseudo-scientific scenes are instruments that make it possible to isolate and compare objects and people.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/5/1/5/3/2/651532-the-world-in-denmark-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=84e5b0863e"},{"name":"Deserter","tagline":"","description":"Deserter follows Ryan Johnson and his wife Jen during their flight from the Central Valley of California to Toronto, Canada.

Desertion means imprisonment, so he decides to flee, realising that there will be no way back. Johnson seeks advice from various helpful organisations that guide him and Jen to Canada. The employees include both Vietnam veterans and young soldiers who have already served in Iraq.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/2/8/5/4/9/628549-deserter-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=413082b031"},{"name":"Il sergente","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/8/7/0/4/0/287040-il-sergente-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=56f2853edf"},{"name":"Paradiset","tagline":"","description":"The third documentary in a trilogy of films about elderly couple Hans and Kerstin Stralstr?m.
