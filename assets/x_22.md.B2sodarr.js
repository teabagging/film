Two adolescent women debate the premise, Whatever Is A Colour Is Necessarily Red, while their contemporaries cheer and heckle their efforts.

The purpose is to set the paradigm for unscripted debating and to instill the value of discussion. There is no winner or loser, only a challenger and defender who both desire to know the truth of something as revealed through the process. In practice monastic debating is a sport performed outdoors in front of an audience who cheers, hisses and boos often at any hesitation or incorrect responses.

Sanguedolce insistently replays loss through a metaphorical landscape while tirelessly focusing on the personally domestic. The films' centre presents a myriad of visual enclosures such as sparsely lit studios, counter tops or framed bathrooms. The characters search throughout the film to find space within the maze of these settings which could allow them to live without the (Dionysian) dissolutions of sexual passion or the (Apollonian) dictates of the law.\\" - Mike Hoolboom","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Riddle: Shout of Man","tagline":"","description":"An optically printed film collage of deteriorating found footage.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/4/1/5/0/4/1041504-riddle-shout-of-man-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=b7e00ba801"},{"name":"Riding the Impossible","tagline":"","description":"Though small, the Icelandic pony is widely renowned for its strength and endurance.

Already establishing the first codes of a choreographic writing that would reach its maturity three years later with 21, a watershed in the trajectory of the company, Rodrigo Pederneiras transforms his corps de ballet into a mass of devalued people who, contrary to what the ordinary Catholic Mass preaches, portrays rather the tragedy and misery of the human condition that the longing for glorification of the Divine. In a state of permanent contrition, the bodies of the dancers ritualize the helplessness, fear, affliction and loneliness inherent in the inapprehensibly earthly and transitory nature of the human species. In the incessant search for verticality, their convulsive gestures sound like cries of mercy.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Yasam ustune bir deneme","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"?

A truck takes Roger and his four friends out into the steep, forested slopes above the rice terraces. With them on the back of the truck are the 'scooters', homemade wooden scooters with which the firewood is driven down to the valley. Once they reach the top, they cut down smaller logs, chop them up and pack their scooters full of them. After this strenuous work, the great fun begins.

Members of the Taupo Work Co-op speak about not having qualifications, how it affects their lives and their aspirations in life if things were different for them. The film explores an underlying tension that is presented by these issues: not having coped with today's education system, yet unable to relate to things Maori because of not being taught by their elders.  Not identifying as part of the Pakeha or Maori worlds leaves many young Maori floating or simply lost in a society from which they feel alienated. For many of these young people living in the cities, life is tough.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Ran for Life","tagline":"","description":"Hong Kong movie","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/4/9/0/3/2/1049032-ran-for-life-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=e6325f7e00"},{"name":"Senpeis Summer","tagline":"","description":"A short animated film adapted from Nagashima Shinjis manga.
