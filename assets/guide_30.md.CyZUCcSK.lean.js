Herman Webster Mudgett Jr., who was buried face down in the late 1800s after achieving the distinction of becoming America's first serial killer, seems to be back and out for revenge. The intrepid reporter has a personal stake in the mystery, as her mother was murdered by a descendant of Mudgett's; she sets out to discover if the urge to kill has been passed down in the blood, or if the culprit is truly from beyond the grave.

Professor Sergius (Elemr Bal) insists that he invented a machine that can fly faster than the speed of earth's rotation and this enables him (or anyone who travels with him) to fly back with it to the past; that is to travel in time. To prove this the professor promises the hand of his daughter Rzsi (Katalin Kardy) and all his possessions to the one who is willing to try the 'space travel' with him in his machine. The romantic and adventurous Hungarian count kos Tibor (Lszl Szilassy) finally accepts the challenge. For the count's luck before the time travel he attends a costume ball dressed as a Hungarian hussar.

Vincent Dieutre has remade Viaggio in Italia and adapted it to his own life. Alex and Kate have become Alex and Tom, played by Vincent himself and his partner Simon. This new couple goes to the same places, experiences similar things, but their time in Naples is inevitably not the same. The city has changed, as has the nature of relationships, tourism has become more digital. As the two become increasingly alienated, Vincent the filmmaker moves through the city with his camera. He talks about how Rossellinis film shaped him. We hear his thoughts about a remake, notes to himself, his discussions with a copyright lawyer. In Vincent and Simons world, much like that of Tom and Alex, the procession of the final scene gives way to a football match. What was still sacred back then becomes a riot here.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/5/2/5/0/6/252506-viaggio-nella-dopo-storia-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=d87d6364e7"},{"name":"Men Have to Go through This","tagline":"","description":"Paul is done with love - until he meets Lena.

He progressively reduced his use of the psychotropic drug lithium, at an experimental clinic in Costa Rica. What ensued was a self-exploration into alternative treatments to treat his condition and a journey delving into the root cause of his mental breakdown.

Coming from one of the greatest families of the Italian aristocracy, he could have been a rich and cultured man, living in opulence and idleness, but Luchino wanted a different destiny. This is the story that director Elisabeth Kapnist and Christian Dumais-Lvowski wanted to tell. Count Visconti di Modrone wears the clothes of a legend that he never stopped shaping throughout his life. This documentary reconstructs the fabric of a brilliant life, dedicated to art; theater, opera, and cinema. This artistic work is also that of a committed man, who was a fellow traveler of the Communist Party, and who resisted fascism.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/8/3/5/3/0/383530-luchino-visconti-between-truth-and-passion-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=5f35675ecf"},{"name":"A Jew Must Die","tagline":"","description":"A film based on Jacques Chessex' novel of the same title; featuring Andr Wilms as Chessex and Bruno Ganz as Arthur Bloch, Swiss Jew killed by Swiss Nazis.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/5/0/9/0/2/350902-un-juif-pour-l-exemple-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=791b570817"},{"name":"Ang Tulay ng San Sebastian","tagline":"","description":"The dead come alive as an ambulance driver and a nurse try to keep awake recounting road ghost stories on a Good Friday, the day of Christs death.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/2/2/7/9/5/322795-ang-tulay-ng-san-sebastian-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=24da2f3cfa"},{"name":"Luisa Spagnoli","tagline":"","description":"This is a true story of Luisa Spagnoli who was an Italian businesswoman, famous for creating a women's fashion store and the chocolate brand, Perugia.
