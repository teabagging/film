His thin, reedy voice was not suited to the talkies, his marriage to Mary Pickford was on the outs, and his son, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., had replaced him as a major box-office draw. Faced with the Hollywood equivalent of a mid-life crisis, Doug called up three of his best friends - director Victor Fleming, cinematographer Henry Sharp, and production manager Charles Lewis - and took them on a six-month tour of Asia, ostensibly to shoot a travelogue for United Artists (of which Fairbanks was still a major shareholder.) Their first stop is Honolulu, followed in quick succession by Japan, China, Peking, Hong Kong, Indochina, the Philippines, Siam, and India. Fairbanks and company spend time at such noteworthy spots as the Taj Mahal, Angkor Wat, the Summer Palace and the Sun Yat-Sen Mausoleum.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/8/9/9/9/9/589999-around-the-world-with-douglas-fairbanks-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=0e6d16eead"},{"name":"The Poetic Justice of Omar Khan","tagline":"","description":"A silent American short drama","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"The Slave","tagline":"","description":"A Greek woman marries a struggling sculptor.

Samara meets inspiring people who carry with them great pain and who, 16 years later, can finally comfort each other by breaking a long silence.

Now, one man has brought them all back to reclaim their lost glory! Shot over seven years (1998-2004), JAM follows the saga of the America Roller Derby League, a group of fading Roller Derby stars who, despite the fact that they are in their 50s and 60s, are determined to make the sport a national sensation once again. At the center of it all is Tim Patten, the league's founder and impresario. Diagnosed HIV positive in 1983, Tim believes his passion for Roller Derby is what keeps him alive. Against all odds he pours thousands of dollars into different schemes, ranging from starting an Internet TV show to hiring models, in an effort to bring in crowds. At the same time, he cares for his partner, David, dying of full blown AIDS. Equal parts hilarious and heartbreaking, JAM takes you into the skater's world on and off the track.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/3/2/8/6/113286-jam-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=32e198c7cb"},{"name":"Octopus Alarm","tagline":"","description":"Alex is intersex.
