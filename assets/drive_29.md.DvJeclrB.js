She tries every trick in the book, including aggressive flirting, which gets her plenty of gropers but no buyers. One day while venturing down a narrow stairwell, she injures her ankle and happens upon Mitsuru who works for some mysterious foreign company. Decked out in high goth style -- complete with long inky black hair and mascaraed eyes -- Mitsuru cuts quite an odd figure, yet his seductive though menacing ways make him difficult for Miyako to resist. Escorting her to his office to treat her ankle, Miyako notices that his all-female staff seem more glassy-eyed and soul-deadened than the average office workers. In fact, they seem almost like zombies. Later, weird things start happening. Mitsuko finds vomit on her doorstep, she seems to be tailed by a shadowy woman in a red dress, and most strikingly, she finds herself utterly powerless against Mitsuru's advances.","rating":"3.31","theme":"Touching and sentimental family stories","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/2/8/0/3/92803-door-iii-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=b3a6552659"},{"name":"Swallowed Souls: The Making of Evil Dead 2","tagline":"","description":"A documentary about the making of Evil Dead 2.","rating":"3.63","theme":"Surreal and thought-provoking visions of life and death","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/0/7/8/2/2/307822-swallowed-souls-the-making-of-evil-dead-2-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=a2452dfd89"},{"name":"No Good Deed","tagline":"HE was more than a cop.

After Mafia by Sherif Arafa, which was a breakthrough in Egyptian cinema making, Tarek El-Aryan brings us Tito, the next logical step. Very simply, this movie is about an ex-con who tries to escape his sinful life by starting a new one, but his past comes back to haunt him. The reason, why Tito is better than Mafia is because the script and story line in Tito is more complex, and some of the characters had real depth in them and where fully developed throughout the movie.","rating":"3.61","theme":"Wild west outlaws and gunfights","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/7/4/8/4/107484-tito-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=81c86e1969"},{"name":"Hanzo the Razor: Who's Got the Gold?","tagline":"","description":"Hanzo extracts a confession from a ghost using his assaulting methods, foils thieves, connects with Heisuke Takei a friend from his youth, offers protection to a forward-thinking physician Genan Sugino who has defamed his ruler, discovers a pleasure ring of young wives and a blind music teacher, and cuckolds a corrupt official under his very nose.","rating":"3.27","theme":"Explosive and action-packed heroes vs. villains","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/1/1/9/3/41193-hanzo-the-razor-who-s-got-the-gold--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=2331975b44"},{"name":"Yellow","tagline":"","description":"In Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, a woman walks into a chadari store in Kabul to buy her first full-body veil and face an uncertain future.","rating":"3.58","theme":"Superheroes in action-packed battles with villains","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/4/6/2/3/3/1046233-yellow-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=a03d8f9429"},{"name":"The Anchor","tagline":"My death should be reported through your voice.","description":"A mysterious informant calls a broadcast news anchor to request that the anchor report on the informants inevitable death.","rating":"3.05","theme":"Western frontier dramas with a touch of humor","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/5/2/8/8/3/552883-the-anchor-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=eb002465f4"},{"name":"Die Geschichte der Menschheit - leicht gekrzt","tagline":"","description":"In order to leave a lasting impression in space, Dr. Georg Friedle and his team of researchers include a condensed version of world history with the 1977 Voyager mission.

A planet where Greek philosophers are celebrated as rap stars, religion is touted as a clever marketing concept, stag parties serve as a secret weapon in the First World War and the construction of the Great Wall of China is a misunderstanding of honest Berlin craftsmanship.
