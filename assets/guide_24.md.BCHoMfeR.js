Many deal with two rates of time measurement, as in CLOCK AND CANDLE, or construct visual paradoxes, as in the shuddering stasis of METRONOME - an illusion caused by the clash between the spring-wound mechanisms of the Bolex camera and of the metronome itself. In BARN DOOR the semi-strobe effect of light pulsations flattens the distant landscape. ... Interestingly, Sherwin has recently returned to the series after almost twenty years, with studies of animals and insects which in part recall the fascination with the 'invisible' side of nature felt by the surrealists, and seen in the scientific writing of Roger Caillois and the films of Jean Painleve during the 1930s.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/4/3/3/5/8/243358-short-film-series-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=636a2f5bfa"},{"name":"The Bride","tagline":"","description":"150 years after she was raped and murdered on her wedding day, the Vengeful Spirit of Aiyana The Apache Warrior Princess comes back and possesses the body of a young bride that faced the same death as her.

Coach Stringer became more well known to the non-sports world in 2007, when the words \\"nappy headed hoes\\" were used to describe the group of young women she led, in spite of tremendous odds, to the National Championship game that same year.

Prior to his breakthrough in 1972, he recorded a proto-metal record and a pop/rock album, eventually redefining glam rock with his ambiguously sexy Ziggy Stardust persona. Ziggy made Bowie an international star, yet he wasn't content with gleaming mere glitter rock. Each one of his phases in the '70s sparked a number of subgenres, including punk, new wave, goth rock, the new romantics, and electronica. Few rock heroes ever had such lasting impact.
