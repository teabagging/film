As a novelty, Starrett not only plays Durango and his \\"alter ego\\" Steve Drake, but also takes on a third identity, that of a hired gun in the employ of the film's bad guys. As one critic noted, this may be the only western in which the hero is obliged to chase himself. Jock O'Mahoney -- later known as Jock Mahoney -- plays a secondary role, and also doubles for Starrett during the riskier stunt sequences.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/7/0/0/0/6/370006-texas-dynamo-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=5b53668d02"},{"name":"Ladronzuela","tagline":"","description":"Homeless girl placed in a court-appointed foster home under the care of a social worker.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/6/0/3/6/7/460367-ladronzuela-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=21bcb6d450"},{"name":"Woodenhead","tagline":"","description":"Short road safety film.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/8/1/4/9/1/181491-woodenhead-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=2b1fb36ead"},{"name":"Sing Me a Song of Texas","tagline":"Big action musical!","description":"The two nieces of the deceased Charley Bronson arrive to learn that an unknown judge will determine which one of them will inherit his ranch.
