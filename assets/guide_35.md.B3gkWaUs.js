When her mother dies and her father is offered a job in Wellington on North Island, Kate is sent to live with an aunt.  The girl runs away to find her father, hopping onto a boxcar and befriending a fellow fugitive, Patrick (Peter Phelps), an emotionally battle-scarred WWI veteran fleeing the authorities after injuring a repo man. Pretending to be father and daughter, Patrick and Kate use each other for cover as they make their way across New Zealand, sleeping under the stars and championing the rights of destitute farmers and homeless squatters whose fortunes have been wiped out by economic hardship.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/5/7/4/5/105745-starlight-hotel-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=b42896fd78"},{"name":"Bottomless bikini, back and forth?","tagline":"","description":"Short 8mm film by Toshihiko Omote.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/4/0/8/3/4/740834-bottomless-bikini-back-and-forth--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=4480c16b2a"},{"name":"Beloved","tagline":"Four people torn between the love of power and the power of love.","description":"A friendship turns south when one of them stole the others' fiance and then asks her to keep the relationship together.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/0/3/4/2/2/303422-beloved-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=93bf15354c"},{"name":"Two Times in One Space","tagline":"","description":"One film projected two times with a difference of a couple of seconds.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/2/4/4/4/9/224449-two-times-in-one-space-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=91baf208cb"},{"name":"Our Season","tagline":"This is said to be director Ryuichi Hiroki's masterpiece, and is still a brilliant masterpiece of gay cinema.","description":"A gay couple is on good terms with each other.
