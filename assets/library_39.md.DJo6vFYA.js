Shot in summer 2002, Live features the barefoot, chummy excitement of piano-centered Something Corporate, some first-rate (even vaguely melodic) thrashing on Anti-Flag's \\"Got the Numbers,\\" galloping folk-punk from Ireland's Flogging Molly, and Reel Big Fish's crisp ska with a Coasters-like sense of humor. The tour's handful of veteran acts--Mighty Mighty Bosstones, NOFX, and Bad Religion among Them--are the tent poles of Vans' moveable feast, and they don't let the rain-soaked crowd down. Breathtaking extras include a visit to the tour's biker-mad Moto-X Park and the half-pipe at the pro BMX skate park.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/9/8/6/9/99869-warped-tour-2002-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=288f06d35a"},{"name":"Between The Sheets","tagline":"","description":"A romantic comedy about an actor and an actress who fake a real life relationship in order to get publicity for a movie that they both star in.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/1/2/5/8/4/512584-between-the-sheets-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=9573e46195"},{"name":"Dreamscapes","tagline":"","description":"Everybody dreams.

As the peasant diligently works at his own survival, the police from the region know he is hiding out somewhere within their jurisdiction, and so his future is anything but secure.

Noh theater is an ancient Japanese classical art-form: austere and highly mythological. For a very long time, it was only performed before aristocrats and the Imperial court. An evening of Noh drama will invariably include a tale of exile, a tale of tragic love, and a ghost story. Often the plays will contain all three. Like many other classical Japanese art-forms, even the stage scenery in Noh is sharply circumscribed and defined; a bridge, a platform and a pine tree must somewhere be in evidence. While the plays may last as long as in more accessible forms of theater, the dialogue in Noh plays is very slim. The stories move slowly and elegantly to their (usually tragic) conclusions, and are enacted with stunning elegance by actors who often wear masks.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Nagrody i odznaczenia","tagline":"","description":"1944.
