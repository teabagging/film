In 1704, Sir Isaac Newton published Light and Refraction, his study of the interactions between sunlight and prisms.  Newton was, as a good scientist, intent on achieving objectivity, which meant studying sunlight in isolation. He thought colors were contained solely in light, and found the spectrum he was looking for.  When he reproduced this experiment, Goethe found another, hidden set of colors missed by Newton. Goethe found the hidden colors in the boundaries between light and darkness.  He felt, as an artist, that one could not talk about light without including darkness. Calling it 'the light-darkness polarity', Goethe made this new scientific discovery using artistic methods in conjunction with science.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/8/9/0/4/9/189049-light-darkness-and-colour-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=19fa3d1294"},{"name":"Psycho","tagline":"","description":"Maryam believes that she does not have much time to live, but two foresights cause her to reject her own feelings.

Tomas, her husband, loves Letty and eagerly defends her against all the village, while she keeps playing her part of a 'femme fatale' with a romantic past and a very adventurous file. But on a windy day, a handsome and strange foreigner appears, coming from the sea, a man just as those Bette Davis used to fall in love with. For Letty, reality begins to look like the most incredible dreams of her. But this will call the police inspector's attention. With that mysterious spy, Letty will be involved in a story that will end as those stories she was so fond of when she was going to the movie theater of her little willage.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/1/1/5/5/5/311555-stolen-moments-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=b1c91c9fdf"},{"name":"Deborah, the Rival","tagline":"","description":"Based on the comic book of the same name by Kaoru Tada.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/5/6/4/3/1/456431-deborah-the-rival-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=49a83f5b60"},{"name":"Rouen, cinq minutes d'arrt","tagline":"","description":"On a sunday, Marguerite and Mario meet while waiting for the train.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/9/2/5/2/1/392521-rouen-cinq-minutes-d-arret-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=52d19cd8c9"},{"name":"Without Air","tagline":"","description":"This independent American feature tells the story of Shay and her boyfriend Radio.

The story of the individualistic fisherman hounded by his neighbors who believe he murdered his young apprentice packs tremendous emotional power. The compelling narrative is richly enhanced by its subtexts: the lone outsider versus the conformist mob; the dreamer of improbable dreams that lead to tragedy; the artist (dreamer) versus the Philistines, and the homosexual overtones of Grimes' abuse of his child apprentices. Britten is conductor of his work and tenor Peter Pears is Grimes, 25 years after he created the title role at the opera's premiere. As the widow Ellen Orford, soprano Heather Harper is magnificent. Best of all, the sea is an ever-present actor here. When we don't see it in the background it exerts its presence in the abundant visual references to nets, barrels, and other paraphernalia of a seaside fishing village.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/2/1/1/9/8/421198-peter-grimes-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=9a374dd211"},{"name":"The lift that went down into hell","tagline":"","description":"A loving couple on an escapade, ending in a hotel room in the underworld.
