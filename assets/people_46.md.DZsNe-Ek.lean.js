We constantly divide the world into 'us against them'. Each time we meet a new person, we define ourselves in contrast to the other. We do not look at what connects us, but what separates us. It seems like something that is pervasive - not just for Denmark, Europe and the US, but in every possible society and culture in the world at all times. It is a common human condition that we have endless difficulty in dealing with the stranger. With this movie, I want to ask a single question that sets the world on fire.

Hastings examines how the Falklands provided a model of a swift and successful war that was matched by other conflicts Britain fought at the end of the 20th-century. In contrast, the long campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan have left the British public sceptical about sending our armed forces in large numbers to war again.  The Falklands could well be the last popular war Britain fights, and certainly the country's last imperial hurrah.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/3/1/5/3/103153-the-falklands-legacy-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=0174c8bd71"},{"name":"Manufacturing Stoke","tagline":"","description":"A groundbreaking documentary, Manufacturing Stoke travels across California's coast, visiting surfing legends and newcomers to explore surfing's great paradox: no sport is as linked to nature, yet most materials used are environmentally toxic.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Shattered","tagline":"","description":"When you've given everything, what do you have left?

By mechanising the means of expression Berlewi sought to arrive at the effect of texture variation without departing from the inherent two-dimensionality of painting.

A contemporary of the Abstract Expressionists and a key figure in the extraordinary social milieu of downtown New York from the 1950s and 60s to the present, his own canvases were amongst the most revered of his peers. In 1964 he made 'Pull My Daisy' with the photographer Robert Frank and in 1966 collaborated with the inimitable poet Frank O'Hara on 'The Last Clean Shirt'. Leslie dramatically moved away from abstraction to make giant almost hyper-real portraits, the majority of which were destroyed in the now infamous fire that ripped through his studio and its neighboring blocks on October 17, 1966. This devastating event, that completely destroyed paintings, films and manuscripts, continues to inform his work today.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Antagonisten","tagline":"","description":"A young man in a gym is faced with a challenge to his worst enemy.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"The Camps","tagline":"","description":"1940s identification photographs document the workers of a factory in one of the first predominantly Black neighborhoods in Mansfield, Ohio.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Christo: Wrapped Walk Ways","tagline":"","description":"Wrapped Walk Ways, in Jacob Loose Memorial Park, Kansas City, Missouri, consisted of the installation of 136,268 square feet (12,540 square meters) of saffron-colored nylon fabric covering 2.7 miles (4.4 kilometers) of formal garden walkways and jogging paths.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/9/1/4/7/4/891474-christo-wrapped-walk-ways-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=feaec0b44d"},{"name":"Falling Star","tagline":"","description":"Once front man of the 90s mega-hit boy band Eye Candy, Bobby Starr's solo career is definitely so low!

Film is therefore a kinetic image, or a moving image. It can make the invisible visible, bring the distant closer, enlarge the small, speed up the slow, slow down the fast, and return the end to the beginning.
