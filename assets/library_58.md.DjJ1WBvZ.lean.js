The burden of its history, however, is still being borne by many: a chronicle of prisoners used in the mine, forced labor, strikes, and coal dust explosions. This documentary is the first to directly confront the legacy of the Miike Mine, reviving through eyewitness testimonies a history of struggle lasting 150 years that modern Japan is trying to forget. It took seven years to complete, interviewing over 70 individuals, from the men and women who signed up to do this backbreaking work and lived in pride by the mountain, to the Koreans who were forcibly brought to Japan and made to work down the shaft. The director Hiroko Kumagai hopes that we look at Miike not just to explore the past, but also to think about the future: what it means to work and to live courageously.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/2/3/9/1/9/523919-echoes-from-the-miike-mine-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=82a53f7b07"},{"name":"Donkey Girl","tagline":"","description":"Farouzi (12) is a dutch-arabian girl that works at a small fishers company.

McClodden describes the video as a portrait of self-contained conflict and rage, with Hemphill gazing directly into the camera. Conceived as a duet between Hemphill and Lorde, it also underscores Hemphills commitment to Black feminist thought, highlighting the transfer of language and influence from one poet-activist to another.

Color, 24 mins, 1998.  From distributor Documentary Educational Resources:  At a street festival in West Africa, a young girl is delighted to discover a video camera trained on her. But her exuberant display is quickly cut short when she recognizes that the cameraman has already lost interest in her. But all is well: he has a document of the moment. Video has tipped the balance in another human interaction, and turned it into a curio.  This experimental video essay probes the complexities of video as a tool for cross-cultural research and representation: it examines, in effect, the politics of its own production. How does the intrusion of this expensive technology distort relationships? What are the ethnographic filmmaker's responsibilites towards his \\"subjects?\\"  Yet perhaps these concerns are themselves distortions, preoccupations that obscure a more balanced encounter, in which human accommodation can flow in both directions.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/6/2/7/8/2/262782-passing-girl-riverside-an-essay-on-camera-work-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=b951f4ef58"},{"name":"Fruit Machine","tagline":"","description":"Mixing fact and fiction, this film tells the story of Dr. F.R.
