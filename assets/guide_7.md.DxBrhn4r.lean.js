Vic falls for gorgeous blonde Wendy (Carol Lynley). The film's title refers to the name of his speakeasy, and to his gang, which consists of himself, Wendy, and a brace comic-relief hoodlums. The Four Deuces opens with cartoon credits, and attempts a stylish comic strip look. Expecting some wit upon seeing the name Don Martin in the credits will drive you stark raving nuts - this is not the cartoonist who worked for \\"Mad\\" magazine. Light bondage and female flesh scenes might have upped ratings for those 1980s \\"Late Late Show\\" airings.

What begins with Chaplin looping around in circular repetitions between a cop and an ominous vagrant becomes more fractured as the film expands. News footage of police arresting protesters (shot from a television screen on black-and-white 8mm film) is cut into the comedy of cops and criminals (a shot of political reality amidst slapstick fantasy) and images are abstracted by rapid-fire cutting. Even the physical cuts on the celluloid become part of the image as Levine chops through the frames themselves, leaving broad gashes on the screen and fracturing images until they overlap with the next shot and the suggestions of narrative are whirled into a frenzy of motion.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/5/8/9/2/3/358923-the-big-stick-an-old-reel-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=0b8aa2c2bf"},{"name":"Letter from the Wife","tagline":"","description":"A worthy companion to Rays Charulata, the film is based on a short story by Rabindranath Tagore where a young wife goes against her family to save a young girl from the atrocities of the society.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/8/4/0/3/8/184038-streer-patra-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=c11be457ac"},{"name":"That Can't Shake Our Willi!","tagline":"","description":"Summer in Germany, anno 1970.

Arriving in his hometown, Ted is shocked to find his elderly mother and younger brother George are penniless. But time is running out, and before he can help them, he's got to get the guns. In setting up the deal, Ted meets and falls for the seductive nightclub owner Maud Ryan who introduces him to the treacherous gangsters who will sell him the artillery.

Like earlier artists who have treated the Faust legend,he uses it to explore the nature of obsession. But reversing the familiar idea of Faust as an old man yearning to be young, Brakhage makes him a world-weary young man who longs to be old... What makes the film striking is its rich imagery, superbly photographed in dark-hued tones, and its insistent visual rhythms. Brakhage is close to his peak as a bard of the camera and the editing table.

The boudoir inside an industrial plant brings an aggressive aesthetics to the teachings and orgies. The takes are developed in different ways. The franzy of orgies has a fast editing, whilst philosophical moments are long sequence shots. By bringing to the contemporary world a 200-year-old romance, we intend to trigger questions about the real moral changes in Western society. It is also interesting to highlight Sade's feminism. His female heroes are independent women, masters of their own sexual drive.
