The Australian Ballets most performed and most successful work has swept the world before it, reaping standing ovations and storms of tears in London, Paris, Tokyo and New York.  The romance of Princess Odette and Prince Siegfried is updated (and complicated) to a contemporary love triangle with the addition of the Baroness von Rothbart, a slinky mistress who has no intention of releasing her freshly married lover. Murphys breathtaking pas de deux and massed swans are framed by legendary designer Kristian Fredriksons darkly sparkling lake, contrasted with the glittering magnificence of regal weddings and ballrooms.

Their inclusion will fit better with the bureaucratic behind-the-scenes narrative of the original cut, and most additional music from the American cut will be included. All Japanese dialogue will remain intact, with English subtitles. Finally, this cut will feature a brand new opening to the film, one that seeks to definitely tie the new Godzilla to the original beast in an eerie and unforgettable way.

By opposing Eichmann's execution, they raised questions about the Holocaust, and also defended the values of Judaism, raising questions about Jewish morality for Israel and the nature of a Jewish State.
