Monsters become metaphors for wickedness suppressed in unrighteousness and its outcome (Rom. 1:18). Second, horror can illustrate the consequences of modernism's humanistic and scientific hubris.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Drag is my Ecstasy","tagline":"","description":"Drag Is My Ecstasy explores the lives of three young men, in and out of drag.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/5/1/4/4/2/1151442-drag-is-my-ecstasy-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=4a8b4bd26e"},{"name":"Dearly Departed: Vol. 2","tagline":"","description":"Scott Michaels and the producers of Dearly Departed Vol. 1 and The Six Degrees of Helter Skelter return with this gripping second installment of the Dearly Departed documentary series.

Few could have predicted that just 60 years after the Wright brothers first managed powered flight, passenger jets would be transporting thousands of people across the globe. Here, we map the history of flight from its beginnings and follow the story through the first half of the 20th century, charting the rapid developments that took place over the next 50 years.  From the Boeing 707 to Concorde, the second half of the 20th century witnessed great change in the accessibility of air travel to almost everyone.

The Georgian duduki, a double-reed wind instrument of the oboe family, is known by different names in neighboring countries such as Armenia, Azerbaijan, Iran and Turkey.  In the 19th century Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, had a large multi-lingual population composed mainly of Georgians, Armenians, Azeri and Kurds, who practised and listened to duduki music. Traditional duduki music, performed by a soloist, a drone player, and a doli drummer who is also a singer, is derived from Middle Eastern styles and repertoires. Georgian musicians in the 20th century developed westernized local styles recalling the famous three-part polyphonic rural singing.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/6/8/4/3/8/1068438-duduki-of-tbilisi-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=0b71ccbd84"},{"name":"Emergence","tagline":"","description":"A malfunction liberates the minds of youth under the control of an oppressive system, allowing them to break free and be themselves.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/8/5/3/0/4/1085304-emergence-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=c45d33ef6c"},{"name":"Exitus Roma","tagline":"","description":"Roman Refugees from the Barbarian Invasions (AD 410).","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"The Faithful","tagline":"","description":"In a large room of a galley or public site, two walls facing each other are covered by video projections displaying a series of portraits originally shot on 16mm film.

The performers all look directly in the camera. The framing remains the same for the six shots. Each shot is the length of a hundred feet of film complete with the leader and flares at the beginning and end of each roll. On the opposite wall, five men are posing in front of a mural within the same formal system. Once projected in a room, the men will appear to be cruising each other from opposite sides of a virtual bar.

But the task was not only to find the perfect concert venue, but also top-class voice and sound conduits for the pieces of the witty conductor and composer.  World-famous soloists such as Thomas Hapson, Anne Sofie von Otter and Marita Solberg gathered on stage and, supported by the Mahler Chamber Orchestra, the Prague Philharmonic Choir and the Boni pueri Boys' Choir, celebrated Mahler's birthday at the very highest level.

Just as men wear makeup (camouflage) as a means of survival to hide their appearance from enemies in war, women wear makeup as a means to survive by highlighting themselves in a patriarchal society. To express this concept, the author cites a camouflage scene in a war movie in which male soldiers perform in the dark. Both male and female makeup and camouflage are related to the survival of society. The work employs a strategy of recontextualization by quoting and transforming the conventional Hollywood movie images (Predator starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, 1987), and transposing them into a colorful make-up scene. As the title of the work shows, the image of a mans face disintegrates over time and evaporates solid masculinity and dichotomous gender differences into iridescent light.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Fragmente zur Magie","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"In the Wake of War","tagline":"","description":"A burgeoning grassroots peace movement in Burundi is aimed at ending civil war between Tutsis and Hutus.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/8/8/3/2/1/888321-in-the-wake-of-war-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=be36e31e7b"},{"name":"Into The Darkness Vol. 2","tagline":"","description":"Recorded At C Markthalle, Hamburg Recorded At C Mera Luna Festival Recorded At C Wave-Gotik-Treffen Recorded At C Jolly Joker, Braunschweig","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/8/8/1/7/2/188172-into-the-darkness-vol-2-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=5001f33434"},{"name":"Jakt och Fiske","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/2/7/3/6/42736-jakt-och-fiske-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=2937baa63d"},{"name":"L'?le phmre","tagline":"","description":"In winter, during the low water season, sand islands appear in the middle of the Mekong.

Lewie has lived all his life in the fishing village of Sambro, Nova Scotia.  The unlikely patriarch of a multi-million-dollar fishing dynasty, he's a man who tackles it all--fair weather or foul--with compassion, pragmatism, infectious humour and a healthy sense of life's absurdities. One Man's Paradise mixes sea-going adventure, humour and great humanity to tell the story of this extraordinary 'ordinary' man who has spent most of his life hunting the largest fish in the sea. The North Atlantic Ocean is harsh and unforgiving--not most peoples' idea of paradise. But seen through Lewie's eyes, it becomes a magical place where we catch a glimpse of what makes life worth living ... not just for him, but for all of us.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"The Apocalypse of Love","tagline":"","description":"Chizuko marries a missionary in charge of an orphanage in the colony of Korea.
