With its evocative imagery and dark-scented ambience, Eroglus elliptic narrative offers an analysis of the illusion of freedom and the mechanics of repression at a time when these sort of reflections can be applied all too well to what is happening in the world around us.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/0/5/5/6/0/505560-a-vacation-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=e36572104b"},{"name":"John Rick","tagline":"","description":"An ex-hitkid comes out of retirement to track down the young gangsters that took everything from him.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Petit jour","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Raidho","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"When the Well Runs Dry","tagline":"Brothers Till The End","description":"When two brothers lose their mother, they must learn what it means to be brothers, all the while finding their new normal.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/3/3/9/0/3/633903-when-the-well-runs-dry-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=a75ddc17f3"},{"name":"Untouchable Love","tagline":"","description":"Liu Zi-ying fell into a coma after an accident, to her surprise she realized her soul has left her body, Zi-ying chanced upon an unsuccessful comic artist, Yang Yi, she constantly encourages him via phone messages, helping him fulfil his...","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/3/9/3/6/7/439367-untouchable-love-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=867a4afe9b"},{"name":"Acid Attack: My Story","tagline":"","description":"Archive footage and reconstructions are used to examine one of the most shocking and bizarre acid attacks of recent years.

MacArthur was a soldier's soldier: the son of an officer, the star of West Point, and the Army's youngest-ever full general. He was already a retired hero when he was recalled in 1941 to face his biggest challenge--defending an unprepared Pacific force against a seemingly unstoppably Japanese war machine. But everything about MacArthurs life was extraordinary; his army brat childhood to his rogue war in Korea, and his magnificent stand in the Philippines to his head-to-head confrontation with an angry Harry Truman. With rare footage and interviews with MacArthur's comrades, family, and friends, this compelling BIOGRAPHY program reveals the man who remains a hero to millions.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/8/8/2/9/1/688291-general-douglas-macarthur-return-of-a-legend-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=e6942de3da"},{"name":"Moose","tagline":"","description":"A young man attempts to be recognised on the international movie database","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"The Mixed Emotions of a Middle Distance Runner","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"No Mail","tagline":"","description":"Small minds in a small town attempt to ostracize the local Muslim postman and their actions divide the town.

There, three Papenburg engineers assembled the ship and received a \\"tropical surcharge\\" for it. And when the First World War broke out, \\"Graf Goetzen\\" even presented itself as a gunboat.

Instead, Courbet had the courage to embark on an artistic adventure few others would have undertaken. Some of his best works are reviewed in this video, including \\"The Stone Breakers\\" and \\"A Burial at Ornans.\\" In his later years, Courbet concentrated on painting many nature scenes.
