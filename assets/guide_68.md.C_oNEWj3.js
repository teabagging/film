In contrast to behaviorist models that see media violence as causing real-world violence, and limited effects models that question the impact of media altogether, Gerbner encourages us to move outside the frame of this debate to consider how the repetitive stories media tell constitute a pervasive cultural environment - a landscape of ritualized, often violent images that have the power to cultivate how we see and understand the world.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/7/8/6/8/1/778681-the-mean-world-syndrome-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=aeba5b45e1"},{"name":"Jos Maza, Sky Traveller","tagline":"","description":"A short documentary interviewing a renown astronomer and astrophysicist.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/4/7/0/9/7/347097-jose-maza-sky-traveller-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=798e75967f"},{"name":"Like a Moth to a Flame","tagline":"You know it will kill you.

On its deepest level, it is a commentary on God;s willingness to punish sinners-and on His capacity for forgiveness. Now you can share this wonderful story with your entire family. The story begins when Jonah is a mere boy.  The forces of the Assyrian Empire have been terrorizing Jonah and his people-and Jonah quickly grows to hate them. He vows that he will one day take his revenge. But years later, God asks Jonah to go and preach to the Assyrians. If Jonah convinces them to renounce their sinful ways, God will forgive them. Jonah, of course, wants them to suffer; he wants them to feel the Lord's wrath. And so he foolishly tries to run away.  Needless to say, God catches up with him. And when He does, Jonah learns a series of important lessons about the power of God's wrath, and the power of His love for all mankind.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/5/9/9/6/15996-greatest-heroes-and-legends-of-the-bible-jonah-and-the-wha-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=592338da7d"},{"name":"Taliesin Jones","tagline":"","description":"Not quite a religious film, not quite a coming-of-age story, not quite a kiddie flick, and not quite a supernatural horror movie, Taliesin Jones's identity crisis nonetheless reveals a sweet examination of one child and his thoughts on God.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/3/5/7/2/23572-taliesin-jones-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=b5ef5ac451"},{"name":"The Man Who Wanted to Classify the World","tagline":"","description":"Paul Otlet was a Belgian, *1868, died 1944, who perfected the Dewey Classification system as \\"the Universal Decimal Classification\\", in his lifetime alone totalling 17 million index cards of human knowledge.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/9/0/1/0/6/190106-the-man-who-wanted-to-classify-the-world-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=addb854d51"},{"name":"Inside Boystown","tagline":"","description":"Documentary of gay hustlers in Vancouver.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/3/1/8/4/23184-inside-boystown-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=6d80fe7384"},{"name":"Coffin of the Memory","tagline":"","description":"After an interruption of thirty years.
