We see how Elizabeth II was no bystander during these great moments of social change, but someone who often led the way, reflecting and engaging with the critical moments in our post-war history.  We reveal how, during these shifting times, not only did we change, but the Queen did too, her time echoed our transformation, the crown moving with the ages.

What would have been considered right-wing xenophobia back then, is now considered mainstream. Populists simplify complex realities into good and evil, victims and perpetrators: us versus them. Their rhetoric often consists of dehumanizing words and metaphors. One of these is water.  In reality, water is not an immediate threat to the average Dutch person; but it is a huge threat to the thousands trying to reach the Netherlands.

So how did the European pioneers survive first the Neanderthals and then the deep freeze as they pushed across the continent?  Alice Roberts reconstructs the head of the 'first European' to come face to face with one of our ancestors; she discovers how art became crucial for survival in the face of Neanderthal competition; and what happened to change the skin colour of these European pioneers.  Finally, spectacular new finds on the edge of Europe suggest that the first known temples may have been a spark for a huge revolution in our ancestors' way of life - agriculture.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/4/9/9/2/104992-the-incredible-human-journey-europe-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=7cc6e1c233"},{"name":"Crumbs","tagline":"","description":"A worker woman lives in her little house, works in a factory, shops in a market.

Each penguin has its own strategy - some rely on thick down coats and fat reserves, others migrate north for the winter or stay on volcano-heated islands. Life in the freezer is getting even tougher as Antarctica's climate starts to change. The ice-loving Emperor penguins may be the first to lose out, but their cousins, the King penguins, are waiting in the wings to take over. All penguins must draw on their ability to defy the odds if they are to survive their greatest challenge yet.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/2/6/3/4/8/826348-penguins-of-the-antarctic-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=0bcdd79bd3"},{"name":"01","tagline":"","description":"A short video by Kyle Canterbury.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Ambiciona","tagline":"","description":"Mexican feature film","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"The Art of Motion","tagline":"","description":"The fourth thematic mini documentary about revolutionary filmmaker Norman McLaren.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Autorretrato de un automvil","tagline":"","description":"Mexican feature film","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/0/2/3/8/5/602385-autorretrato-de-un-automovil-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=5571675c9a"},{"name":"Chico Buarque - Palavra-Chave","tagline":"","description":"44 clips about themes, places and people that have appeared on the series","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/4/4/9/6/2/544962-chico-buarque-palavra-chave-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=f06c67b3e6"},{"name":"Dance Got Me","tagline":"","description":"Several years ago Bawren Tavaziva was an unemployed teenager dancing on the streets of Zimbabwe's townships to earn enough money to eat.

I chose the footage less for the content of the speech and more for the global recognition factor. This televisual image of Jackson is also just a visually arresting image with a dream-like quality to it, thanks to the saturated colors and the shocking whiteness of his face. [...] The scene seems staged and affected. This footage is paired with a second video image showing a chorus of 80 men and women performing Jacksons monologue in unison. [...] I slowed down the Jackson footage, synching the movement of his mouth to match the measured pace of the chorus. In the resulting slow motion image, Jackson appears to be struggling to speak, as though hes stuck in some viscous medium and can barely move.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""}]`),L={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:I},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},H={class:"card-container"},R=["disabled"],W={key:0},P={key:1};function E(s,i,t,m,l,o){const c=f("PoemCard");return a(),n("section",null,[i[1]||(i[1]=e("div",{class:"top-banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[e("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎬 Movie Showcase 🥳")])],-1)),e("div",H,[(a(!0),n(u,null,b(o.visiblePoems,(h,p)=>(a(),y(c,{key:p,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),o.hasMorePoems?(a(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:l.isLoading,onClick:i[0]||(i[0]=(...h)=>o.loadMore&&o.loadMore(...h))},[l.isLoading?(a(),n("span",P,"Loading...")):(a(),n("span",W,"See more"))],8,R)):v("",!0)])}const O=d(L,[["render",E],["__scopeId","data-v-7361bd2d"]]),G=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/2.md","filePath":"quotes/2.md"}'),N={name:"quotes/2.md"},J=Object.assign(N,{setup(s){return(i,t)=>(a(),n("div",null,[w(O)]))}});export{G as __pageData,J as default};
