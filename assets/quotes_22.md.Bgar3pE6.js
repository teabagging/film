A unique experience, this is a very significant and totally original film that will test, and reward any audience. The challenge is to spend time with lonely old people and Dolak is unflinching. He handles words, sounds and image with extreme care. His film is composed of long takes that juxtapose a daily routine alongside the expansive and empty landscapes of the north east, and both shot in exquisitely beautiful monochrome.

Having come onstage over an hour late, it was unlikely the band would complete an epic 25 track set list. At midnight, event organisers were forced to invoke a Council-imposed curfew, which prompted complaints from Axl Rose and threats of the band's non-appearance at the Leeds festival the following night.

At the core of this engaging autobiographical film is an interview with Filippos mother, as she recounts incidents of exploitation and gender discrimination she experienced working in jewelry factories in the 1940s and 50s. The filmmaker contrasts her mothers quiet acquiescence with her own attitudes about the social injustices of her culture through a striking montage of images and audio clips - moving the viewer to consider connections between consumerism and global labor practices, motherhood, money and happiness. While her mother's attitude toward the social injustices she endured is one of resignation, Filippos is one of assumed but uncollected responsibility.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"36","tagline":"","description":"36 refers to both aesthetic traditions of abstract painting and the structural approaches of early geometric films (such as those of Walther Ruttmann and Hans Richter).

One has the happy feeling that mushroom would have felt better in those days. ImplicitIndian Diary - Days at Sree Sankara also pays homage to Robert Gardner and his Great Song on the Burning Forks of Benares, Forest of Bliss (1986), whom Fungus loves so fervently as if it were a piece of him - he likes to tell that sometimes when watching the film, he thinks he has shot this or that scene.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Last Ball","tagline":"","description":"High school is over, and everybody in the small town just up the Hudson from New York City where Jim lives has made plans and moved on.

Its interest lies in the static objects that tell us nothing about the life of the filmmaker. The NEW YORK CITY DIARY '74 is filled with color and texture, mostly abstract. (...) Guttenplan dislocates the viewer's vision by a perpetual permutation of surfaces. The film's field of vision can unpredictably change from a small area of bricks to a cloudy sky covering several kilometers. The intensity of colors and patterns remains constant while the photographed space changes completely.
