This documentary brings back one of those ignored fragments through the figure of Carlos Procopiuk, a man who inhabited, like nobody else, the ethics and aesthetics of a cinema made in a rabidly independent way. An all-terrain character who acted, wrote, produced, edited, directed and taught his community, in Neuqun between the 1950s and the 1990s, how to make films. With the memory still fresh and the eloquent images from his works, the documentary by Diego Lumerman settles a small part of that inestimable debt that Argentine film has with its history.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/8/1/6/1/4/1081614-procopiuk-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=3c48b33a65"},{"name":"House of Kardashian","tagline":"The untold story from those who know them.","description":"A new documentary series from the Kardashians, featuring never-before-seen archival footage and interviews from the familys inner circle, including Caitlyn Jenner.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/3/0/1/8/2/1130182-house-of-kardashian-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=d58daa9ecd"},{"name":"Disappearances","tagline":"","description":"super8 affair with lots of images rushing past, blowing thru an english winter, in a brief, fragile sort of way","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/4/1/2/0/1/1041201-disappearances-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=19c127bd47"},{"name":"What is Art","tagline":"","description":"An anthological absurdist sketch comedy voyage that takes viewers on a trip through space, time, and really cool houses - all in search of the answer to the ultimate question: What is art?","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/2/6/0/3/6/1026036---0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=5a0c78cf90"},{"name":"Air: Courting a Legend","tagline":"","description":"Sonny Vaccaro and Nike pursue basketball rookie Michael Jordan, creating a partnership that revolutionizes the world of sports and contemporary culture.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Sea of Black, Glimmer of Light","tagline":"","description":"Two lesbian lovers and their friend visit Redondo Beach on a December night.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/7/2/2/6/0/972260-sea-of-black-glimmer-of-light-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=69a25f430a"},{"name":"Costco at Christmas","tagline":"","description":"A look at Costco during the holiday season.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/9/7/3/4/6/1097346-costco-at-christmas-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=87b4cff962"},{"name":"Peacock Lament","tagline":"","description":"Amila comes from a small village in Sri Lanka.

But to the Ngurrara people it is a map, made from memory, of a place where their ancestors lived for over 60,000 years. It is a direct connection to their land - a country where kartiya (non-Aboriginal people) could not live in, because the desert is an impossible environment without knowledge of how to hunt, gather, and find water. The canvas is a strong symbol of solidarity, and of resistance to the colonial project that attempted to decimate the Ngurraras connection to their land - now known generically as the Great Sandy Desert.  We Were Lost in Our Country explores questions of personal agency, inherited trauma, and intergenerational transmission, through a conversation among ancestors and descendants. As the voices of the young find their bearings and make their mark on the words of their ancestors, Tuan Andrew Nguyen accesses a past-and-present history of the canvas - a history of displaced memory and of its recreation.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/9/7/3/0/3/697303-we-were-lost-in-our-country-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=9d02ca2aef"},{"name":"BTS World Tour: Love Yourself: Speak Yourself - Saudi Arabia","tagline":"","description":"BTS World Tour : Love Yourself is the third worldwide concert tour headlined by the South Korean boy band BTS to promote their Love Yourself series, Love Yourself 'Her', Love Yourself 'Tear' and Love Yourself 'Answer'.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/8/8/7/7/1/1088771-bts-world-tour-love-yourself-speak-yourself-saudi-arabia-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=69091a42c6"},{"name":"The Creatress","tagline":"","description":"Young, bestselling author Eryn Bellow concludes her bookstore tour with her agent selling film rights and closing a six figure advance for her follow-up.

The film begins with an eye injury, followed by a multi-color dot pattern that approximates damaged-as-seen-through-a-screen eyesight. A scratch pattern is introduced that is identical with a recurring eye aberration associated with a detached retina. A flowering Agrimony plant appears, the name meaning a wound to the eye. A catharsis is reached at the point that the scratched pattern changes to its negative and transforms to color negative. This introduces other painted and sanded film sequences that resolve the catharsis of incoming images into a visual-world-unto-itself.\\" - Stan Brakhage","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"L E C","tagline":"","description":"In the suburbs of Rio, the everyday life of T.B., a young woman who can't make up her mind whether to stay or to join her sister who lives elsewhere.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/7/3/9/8/8/573988-la-e-ca-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=3a7d10c834"},{"name":"Las nueve caras del miedo","tagline":"","description":"A TV crew alongside a medium, a friar and a killer with regrets spend the night inside a haunted hotel, place where a guy murdered prostitutes in the 1950's.
