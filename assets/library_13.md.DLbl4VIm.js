Kenyatta entered politics in the mid-1920s and then spent 17 years in exile in Europe. He returned to Kenya in 1946, and was elected president of the nationalist movement, the Kenya African Union. Arrested and imprisoned in 1952 for allegedly leading 'Mau Mau', he was released in 1961 and two years later became Kenya's first Prime Minister. In power, the man whom European settlers had once reviled as \\"the leader to darkness and death\\" was eulogized by them as a pillar of stability, while former allies challenged him by creating a left-leaning political opposition. Kenyatta weaves archival and contemporary images with interviews with friends and relatives, comrades and opponents, to create a biographical portrait of a key figure in 20th century politics, and a case study of what Frantz Fanon called the pitfalls of nationalism as a political force in Africa.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/7/0/2/0/3/970203-kenyatta-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=3ad1c576e5"},{"name":"Distant Activities","tagline":"","description":"Real time development of a video feedback, processed and controlled through a video keyer.

The method he developed uses a child's own natural instrument, the voice. Beginning with simple musical intervals, the child progresses from folk tunes and children's songs to the complex notes and rhythms of composed music--from Bye baby bunting to Bach. [The film] is a look at the Koda?ly method of music training in public elementary schools in San Jose, California, and West Hartford, Connecticut. Ordinary children are shown in the film, but they exhibit extraordinary self-confidence, discipline, concentration, and an eagerness to learn. There is no such thing as failure in a Koda?ly classroom; in fact, the children are able to correct their mistakes themselves. Moreover, the children will bring much of 'how' they learn in their music lessons--counting and problem-solving, left-to-right progression, following directions--to their study of reading, writing and arithmetic.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/9/9/2/0/9/499209-music-lessons-the-kodaly-method-in-the-american-classroom-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=c0475fda63"},{"name":"The Way to The Gold Medals","tagline":"","description":"About Soviet and Japanese volley-ball players who are both rivals and friends.

Wang Ye, believed to ward off diseases and evil spirits, is celebrated through building, parading, and burning a wooden boat. Without interviews or dialogue, the visual narrative invokes spirituality and imagination through depictions of people, fire, and the god.  This film is not a documentation of folk traditions, but a reconstruction of how the villagers enact their pilgrimage and interact with their gods of spirits. The religious rituals in Taiwan are always noisy and seemingly chaotic, yet with a strong force of life. To make the meaning of the ritual easier to grasp, the film tries to reveal passion and paranoia of the pilgrims and turn it into a spectacle of joy and pathos.

In Anorexie 4 the voice shapes the images (the play of chess and of light) and in Dcembre 79, shot in the same abandoned mining region, the photos shape the film: chemical deposits, fossils instantaneously striped and imprinted by signs of life and haunted by their ghostly presence. A space of dreary grey, of desolation, which is in a never-ending process of dying because the place, even before being filmed, already went through a vampire-like depletion.

The tunnel links the Rhineland in Germany with Italy and goes through the Swiss mountains. The many lives lost in the building of the first tunnel were considered to be one of the costs for economic progress. In one re-enactment, a strike for better conditions is severely dealt with by the military. Even in 1972, though working conditions were better, most of the men working on the tunnel were poor immigrant workers, with almost no power to negotiate better treatment.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/2/9/3/2/4/329324-san-gottardo-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=bff7d23087"},{"name":"Max Beeza and the City in the Sky","tagline":"","description":"A mysterious airship attacks the towering city in the sky and only comedian Max Beeza can save the day.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/3/9/1/7/8/439178-max-beeza-and-the-city-in-the-sky-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=39d38671eb"},{"name":"Our Lady of Guadalupe","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/6/6/5/1/7/166517-our-lady-of-guadalupe-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=3d07bbca97"},{"name":"Daylight Train","tagline":"","description":"Two old friends living in Moscow and St. Petersburg are hoping to get their children married.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/3/5/4/2/63542-daylight-train-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=49f04ee875"},{"name":"The Romance in the Ghost House","tagline":"","description":"A group of travelers get trapped in a haunted house.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/8/3/4/5/3/383453-the-romance-in-the-ghost-house-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=81aa8d7ed9"},{"name":"Muszla","tagline":"","description":"The hectic life of a modern city.

The variety of character twists in this film which is reminiscent of romantic comedies such as Roman Holiday and Shakespeares Twelfth Night. The queen mother with a fancy royal costume but wears glasses because of her poor vision, and the court ladies who protect the princess day and night are usually slow and doze off but have the strength to push against male henchmen. The princes outside the palace walls seem like that of a na?ve country girl who eats a rice cake at the marketplace because she thinks its free.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/6/5/4/5/7/665457-one-sided-love-of-princess-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=da48add8f8"},{"name":"Shellarama","tagline":"","description":"A celebration of Shell Petroleum, tracing its manufacture from discovery in oil fields to its eventual use as fuel for modern living across the globe.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/9/0/3/1/9/290319-shellarama-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=5a4a9f9b74"},{"name":"Universidade em Crise","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/4/9/2/0/5/449205-universidade-em-crise-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=1be3f7134b"},{"name":"Should I Marry Outside My Faith?","tagline":"","description":"A short drama which seeks to explore some of the problems in inter-faith relationships.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/2/8/4/3/3/328433-should-i-marry-outside-my-faith--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=104f734963"},{"name":"Marcel Proust - Portrait Souvenir","tagline":"","description":"This documentary is a portrait of Proust composed of recollections by those who knew him.
