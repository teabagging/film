Unburdened by post-war reparations, Americans were preoccupied with other developments like NASA, the game-changing space programme that put Neil Armstrong on the moon. Yet it was astronauts like Eugene Cernan who paved the uneven, perilous path to lunar exploration. A test pilot who lived to court danger, he was recruited along with 14 other men in a secretive process that saw them become the closest of friends and adversaries. In this intensely competitive environment, Cernan was one of only three men who was sent twice to the moon, with his second trip also being NASAs final lunar mission. As he looks back at what he loved and lost during the eight years in Houston, an incomparably eventful life emerges into view. Director Mark Craig crafts a quietly epic biography that combines the rare insight of the surviving former astronauts with archival footage and otherworldly moonscapes.","rating":"3.59","theme":"Emotional and touching family dramas","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/0/0/6/4/3/200643-the-last-man-on-the-moon-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=2c5d573dbb"},{"name":"Pink Moon","tagline":"Till your wish do us part","description":"A young woman struggles to cope with her elderly father's out-of-the-blue announcement he considers his life complete and will end it by his next birthday.","rating":"3.52","theme":"Faith and religion","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/6/8/2/2/7/868227-pink-moon-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=47a9dfc8ec"},{"name":"Gor","tagline":"A new dimension in fantasy.","description":"American professor Tarl Cabot is transported via a magical ring to planet Gor, where he must help an oppressed country overthrow its evil king and his barbarian henchmen.","rating":"2.3","theme":"Horror, the undead and monster classics","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/3/0/1/7/73017-gor-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=9ee0c81e43"},{"name":"Lydia","tagline":"The Story of a free woman and her romances!","description":"Lydia MacMillan, a wealthy woman who has never married, invites several men her own age to her home to reminisce about the times when they were young and courted her.
