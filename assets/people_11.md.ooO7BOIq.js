This documentary explores an ever-growing hysteria focusing on the supernatural. This film features interviews with occultic experts, as well as high-ranking witches, druids and an interview with a former vampire. Former occultists share their testimonies, responding to the lure of Wicca by describing the devastating bondage in their own lives. They conclude with deliverance through the life-changing authority of the one True God. They compare the deceptive experiences in the occult with the Peace and Joy found in Jesus the Messiah, a showcase of His mercy and incomparable power.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/0/1/0/9/8/801098-pop-culture-paganism-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=30b95d226d"},{"name":"Beautiful Awakenings","tagline":"","description":"One night in a shady hotel room.

When the Beijing police want to arrest his brother for murder, Hong Kong lawyer Shen goes to Beijing to help. Time and again he butts heads with differences between Hong Kong and Mainland law and practice. Thanks to a persistent though traditional lawyer named Wu and an implacable but fair policewoman named Lan, Shen manages to keep out of jail and pursue his brother's innocence. The big problem is that the dead man, a pimp and a bully, is the son of a wealthy and influential man who'll stop at nothing to avenge his son's death.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/5/6/9/4/5/656945-law-on-the-brink-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=f201e7bc0f"},{"name":"Marooned","tagline":"","description":"The film centers around Peter Camaron who works at Left Luggage at a train station.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Yakov Smirnoff: What A Country!","tagline":"","description":"Yakov Smirnoff delivers some of his best material in this hilarious stand-up comedy special.
