Yet, even at the peak of his fame, his performances were variously criticised for being too opulent, too manicured, lacking warmth or spiritual depth.  This musical profile explores the many paradoxes in the life and music of this controversial figure, who forged his international reputation in London with the Philharmonia Orchestra shortly after the end of the Second World War and went on to reign supreme in the classical music world during his three decades with the Berlin Philharmonic. The film also examines Karajan's belief in the visual power of music, and his determination to leave behind a substantial legacy of music on film.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/3/3/5/1/2/333512-karajan-s-magic-and-myth-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=8bae020124"},{"name":"Miss Earth","tagline":"","description":"Victoria Young is thrust into Galactic's depopulation pageant and forced to fight for the survival of our planet.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/2/9/4/9/2/629492-miss-earth-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=3d073c5c5b"},{"name":"Ressha Sentai ToQger DVD Special: Farewell, Ticket!

On her journey, she is waylaid by bandits, and becomes entangled in the political problems of a neighboring country, whose ruler Prince Dantan, has been ousted by his evil half-brother Gabriel. Dantan, disguised as a simple goat hunter, has been driven into hiding in the mountains with his followers. Beverly is rescued by his band of rebels, but is mistaken for Princess Yestive. Beverly and Dantan fall in love, but their romance is complicated, not only by the hostilities between the two countries, but also because neither of them knows the true identity of the other.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/5/4/5/7/2/554572-beverly-of-graustark-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=367779d61a"},{"name":"The Waves of the Sea and Love","tagline":"","description":"Romantic silent film about a merchant ship carrying gunpowder, while two men vie for the hand of the captains daughter.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/5/0/4/7/6/550476-des-meeres-und-der-liebe-wellen-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=b3b6403a75"},{"name":"Town of Tartu and Its Surroundings","tagline":"","description":"A short tour of the sites to see in and around Tartu.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/9/9/6/7/4/399674-town-of-tartu-and-its-surroundings-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=ec97cf9192"},{"name":"Little Red Riding Hood","tagline":"","description":"A little girl walks through the woods to deliver food to her sickly grandmother, only to discover a wolf in her stead.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/2/3/1/9/0/423190-little-red-riding-hood-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=b4ec1a5ea5"},{"name":"Tying the Red Light on the Tiger's Tail","tagline":"","description":"There is painted backdrop with a wooden fence in front of it and three steps leading to a porch.
