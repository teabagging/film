Every action, decision, and all the tensions, elation, gaffes and bouts of craziness were filmed as they happened. And then along came editor Catherine Vilpoux, faced with 580 hours of rushes and a titanic exercise in viewing, sorting, selecting and assembling. Gradually the film took shape a shape that reflects the Thatre du Soleil's commitment to finding the right theatrical form. Ultimately, is this a film about stage directing? About a troupe of actors?

The moment breathes a glimmer of hope that she may actually be able to grasp hold of something meaningful in her life... however, as quickly as the moment comes, it disappears. And once it is over her reality crashes in to her again and Fox falls back in to her vacant cycle. SEVEN P.M. is a glimpse in to a day in the life of Fox and her obsessive desperation to meet her own deadline.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/0/2/2/5/3/402253-seven-p-m--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=d0e579f33b"},{"name":"Der alte Mann und das Meer","tagline":"","description":"Animated film by Bruno Sukrow, which has some borrowings from the Hemingway book of the same name.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"H?lkke 9","tagline":"","description":"A retro commercial for the nuclear-powered H?lkke 9 cooker, which makes old-fashioned, time-consuming cooking with its inconveniences such as grease splashes a thing of the past.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/2/5/8/6/5/1025865-halkke-9-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=d407ad9e92"},{"name":"Son de la Calle","tagline":"","description":"A group of young people who are fighting for union and tolerance within a guild and a hostile society where the music will be her only inspiration.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/7/1/3/5/4/271354-son-de-la-calle-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=97ce05572c"},{"name":"Lost Images: The Other Eye of Juan Pinzs","tagline":"","description":"The filmmaker Juan Pinzs goes on a physical and also inner journey, in search of some lost images that he filmed in the 80s.
