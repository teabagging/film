However, it can also be taken to refer more broadly to the obtuse behaviour of the main characters in the play. The play is an odd mixture of pathos and nihilism, written against the bleak background of Stalinist totalitarianism from which Hungary was emerging. As with much modern drama, there is no hero in the play. The only noble behaviour that one can find belongs to one of the characters in the past, when he was a child, but he is no longer as he was. The hint that what once existed might be achieved again is the only faint ray of hope in a very bleak view of the human condition.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/4/4/2/3/1/244231-csirkefej-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=dbdd2e4de8"},{"name":"Exit-exil","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/9/6/3/4/2/496342-exit-exil-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=12302f28e1"},{"name":"Der Trip","tagline":"","description":"Short film by SCHMELZDAHIN","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/1/5/4/0/3/515403-der-trip-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=f482d5941c"},{"name":"Tenko Reunion","tagline":"","description":"In 1950, five years after their release from internment, the women return to Singapore for a reunion, unaware of the intrigue that is to involve them in treachery and murder.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/2/8/4/1/5/528415-tenko-reunion-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=0edb385579"},{"name":"Ali Setan","tagline":"","description":"A story about a very naughty graduate named Ali who is always in Asmidars hair disturbing in all kinds of manor.
