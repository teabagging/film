The movies director Herbert Selpin was arrested by the Gestapo over comments he made about the ships crew and he was questioned by Goebbels. Selpin was found dead the next day in his cell. The Gestapos verdict was suicide. Titanic never received the impressive premiere that Goebbels intended, being first shown in Nazi-occupied Paris in 1943.

During the post-World War I period, Germany suffered from hyperinflation and the near-starvation of many working people. Working conditions were extremely bad, and there was a very vocal socialist movement. Despite fears that communists of one sort or another might take over the country, there was only one communist-led uprising, in 1923, and it was brutally suppressed. The uprising was a useful stick for governmental forces seeking greater social control, however, and it strengthened the tendency of the already weak Weimar regime to govern by emergency decree. An additional consequence was that the use of private militias was legitimized. These tendencies laid the groundwork for Hitler's takeover of power not too many years later. This documentary uses rare and never-before seen film footage from the strike and from that era.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Mig og dig","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/3/6/0/2/2/236022-mig-og-dig-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=f7bb033561"},{"name":"Reseminne","tagline":"","description":"Fragmentary images from a journey to the Alps.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/4/1/6/1/7/441617-reseminne-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=414fc2ba9c"},{"name":"The Longest Night","tagline":"","description":"The action takes place during the Second World War.

A 27-episode anime adaptation was produced by Toei Animation and originally aired on Japan's Nippon Television from April 1 to September 23, 2003.

Poetry gave her an opportunity to confront the white German society with its own prejudices. The film shows the author in performances in South Africa and in Germany.
