The film largely treats the relationship with her late husband, poet Petr Kabe?, and the feeling of loneliness she has been facing since his death. It is definitely not a conventional documentary portrait, since the director does not ask questions, and instead lets Karenina voice out her thoughts and feelings, observing her with a casual camera during work or on her mountaineering trips. The film also serves as an implicit proof of love to analogue medium: not only the book, but analogue film as well, with its invisible, yet almost tangible features.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/4/1/3/5/8/941358-found-by-the-one-she-seeks-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=06009dca7f"},{"name":"Tear Off","tagline":"","description":"A young bee must overcome her condition if she is to survive the destructive hornet that has invaded her hive.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/3/8/6/5/5/938655-tear-off-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=3f4af003c5"},{"name":"On Your Behalf","tagline":"","description":"We all have pet peeves which make us say 'I could kill them'.

With cities everywhere struggling to cope with the population growth that increased urbanisation brings, can video games be harnessed to help the residents, especially young people, take part in planning, and fixing their own cities?  Today public spaces and entire cities are being designed, planned and played through the medium of games. The result of this civic gamification is that city architecture and urban planning is being democratized. Cities have become the ground zero for digital innovation and the debate about how our cities evolve has suddenly gone viral.  We follow three game companies navigating the space where urban planning and gaming meet. Lydia Winters at the game developer Mojang, the creators of Minecraft, Paradox Interactive and the game Cities: Skylines and Jos Sanches and his indie game Blockhood.
