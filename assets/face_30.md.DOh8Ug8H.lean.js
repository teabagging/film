The bridge has been moved from its original location as originally the railway viaduct was situated four kilometers further north.

A Celebration of Origins, filmed in 1980, depicts the first celebration of these rituals since 1960. The rituals, which require the participation of the entire community, had been delayed by poor harvests and epidemics. The film focuses on a small group of ritual leaders who struggle to hold the celebration in the absence of the Source of the Domain, the ritual leader of the community, who died after initiating the rituals. Evoking the contested nature of ritual, the film demonstrates how ritual performance implicates delicate political relationships based on pragmatic alliances, festering antipathies or developing jealousies.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/6/5/3/6/7/865367-a-celebration-of-origins-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=f7a6ae90c5"},{"name":"Czy ktos mnie kocha w tym domu","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/6/8/4/0/116840-czy-ktos-mnie-kocha-w-tym-domu-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=3556c3ef7a"},{"name":"Ein Engel fr Felix","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"El potro indomable","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/9/1/1/7/5/691175-el-potro-indomable-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=b3298366d5"},{"name":"Endstation Harembar","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Esta vieja es una fiera","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Flight of the moth","tagline":"","description":"Hiding from the police captain, a prostitute ends up in the room of a quiet, modest pianist from the United States who takes part in a competition in the resort town by the sea.

Renowned for his boxing skills, speed and ability to slip punches, the famed southpaw became an oriental champion at all weights from bantamweight to lightweight. To this day, Elorde holds the junior lightweight division for the longest title reign of nearly seven-and-a-half years, defending the crown he won with a spectacular 7th round knockout of Harold Gomes before 26,000 screaming fans at the inauguration of the Araneta Coliseum on March 16, 1960, 10 times against the top contenders. Elorde was the first Asian inducted into the New York-based International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1993 and was also enshrined in the World Boxing Hall of Fame. With his skills and humility both inside and outside the ring, \\"Flash\\" Elorde will always remain a tribute to the sport. He was a quintessential Filipino who \\"feared no man but was humble before all men.\\"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/0/0/8/8/2/1000882-the-flash-elorde-story-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=4076856e50"},{"name":"Nitchaya Thamboolam","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Espacio dos","tagline":"","description":"\\"I consider that Espacio dos and Tiempo dos must be considered as important works .
