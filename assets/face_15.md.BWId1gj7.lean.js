A powerful story of complicated times around 1968, a story full of contrasts: Whether it is the relation between what Grandpa's plentiful life entails and Tonda's imminent children's presence, or between poetry and fine humor and dramatic situations of military occupation. Or generally between everyday worries of a person and the pressure of great history. On grandpa's life story, mapping a big part of the 20th century traumas, one can see how much an individual's fate depends on the movement and changes of history. And how much one can defy it and maintain inner firmness and integrity. Or perhaps just dear life.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Asesinos Notables","tagline":"","description":"Anthology film of classics police stories written and directed by Marcos Moreno","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/7/8/6/5/3/1178653-asesinos-notables-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=942e629e7a"},{"name":"Sala Escura","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Puppet","tagline":"","description":"A girl dances with the roots of a tree like a puppet and bites an apple, and then the world is disturbed and the girl is thrown into another world and.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Seltser City 4: The Infected","tagline":"One Egg To Rule The World","description":"The furious beast The Tickle Monster has changed his face and hes back for revenge.

The CineKursaal went through the Nazi occupation, survived the devastation of World War II, resisted the growing success of television in the 1970s, and renewed itself by automating the projection room in the late 1980s. Not even the advent of multiplexes, the temporary closure of theaters due to the pandemic, and the growing success of streaming platforms were able to interrupt the CineKursaal's glorious history. Through the personal recollections of its owner Raymond Massard, great-grandson of Conrad Massard who first managed the cinema in 1911, the short documentary tells the story of a cultural infrastructure rooted in Luxembourg's history.

Cuttin' the cord is a song of release, a fighter song, a song of regaining your own power and discovering your true potential and following your inner voice. Putting your foot down and creating those necessary boundaries. Fighting against those who hold us down or tell us we are no good. Those who keep us in bound and stagnant energy while we try to discover our purpose here during our short time on Earth. The video is a symbolic artistic expression of these things.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/1/7/8/8/9/817889-lunarcode-cuttin-the-cord-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=56a23f0827"},{"name":"Who's A Good Man?","tagline":"","description":"Girl meets boy.

She often holds ceremonies at a well-known rock drawing site. Mambo Chirara is not pleased with the old lady's activities.

As a pigeon, she is supposed to build a nest to lay her eggs, but she fundamentally doubts her part in the cycle of life. Several absurd scenes show her struggle with popular belief, and nightmarish fantasies around the trappings of parenthood, and indirectly address reproductive rights without perpetuating the polarising perspective present in ongoing public debate. The spell-like remarks of the crow could be seen as her conscience echoing societys expectations around reproduction. The presence of the egg as a haunted object with magical properties in this film becomes an unsettling interpretation of (in)fertility as a curse. The video incorporates various digital and hand-made techniques like stop-motion animation, set design, sound design and performance to unfold an uncanny world.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/3/9/8/3/5/939835-unborn-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=dd9bf767f9"},{"name":"Venezia.
