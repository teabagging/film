Incredibly, the public sector in Britain is now bigger than the private sector. That's an almost Communist level of state control. And as with all Communist countries, it has left its citizens needlessly impoverished, unhealthy, ill-educated and poorly housed.

In a sit down interview, Adam deep dives into his pathway to success. Stories from 'Farscape', the opening of Fox studios, to the stark reality of leading the mould shop in prosthetics at the age of 20, and the lessons he learnt along the way whilst creating his dream career. Taking inspiration from supernatural, sci-fi 90s classic films and monsters through the mind of a 10 year old in 1985, guided by the words of his 43 year old self in 2023. We explore how an 'odd one out' kid, feeling the pressure and disregard of society can become a pioneer for prosthetics and animatronics across Australia and Hollywood.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/3/5/2/4/4/1135244-odd-one-out-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=e122f38932"},{"name":"Don't Sleep","tagline":"It isnt always fun to dream.","description":"It isnt always fun to dream.

Rare. For Sale.","tagline":"","description":"Precious. Rare. For Sale. takes a broad sweep at the presentation of nature in Vietnamese moving images from the 1990s. From being an abode for majestic and magical beasts, to serving as a backdrop for war heroics and social realist tragedies, representations of nature have been shaped by Vietnams changing socio-political contexts.  Reflecting on how filmmakers have portrayed the environment, Bi questions the ethics of exploiting nature for the camera. While early ethnographic films shot by the French depicted the Vietnamese jungle as an untouched, primitive landscape, todays images of razed forests and neatly-partitioned land plots reveal how nature has become a commodity for a rising middle-class.

In total secrecy a 28-mile ring of steel had been erected in the dead of night, forming a barrier between east and west Berlin and tearing the city in two.  This new and exclusive film tells the incredible story of how that night of 13th August unfolded, and traces the events leading up to the partition of this historic European city. Using eyewitness reports and letters from the families and soldiers that lived through the nightmare, the film also uses East German sources and archive footage taken from the 12 hours leading up to the erection of the wall.  The Night The Iron Curtain Closed provides a chilling account of how, overnight, a new country was born, an old country was cut in half and how the Berlin Wall heralded the birth of the Cold War.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/0/5/4/7/2/405472-berlin-wall-the-night-the-iron-curtain-closed-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=52d0d98947"},{"name":"Heaven","tagline":"","description":"Two inspiring real-life stories are intertwined with never-before seen footage of Billy Graham talking about heaven, filmed at his North Carolina mountain home.
