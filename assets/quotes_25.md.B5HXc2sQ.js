Unlike most other motorcycle races the TT is a time trial and pits competitors against the clock rather than against each other.  In 1911 Frank Phillip on a potent two-stroke Scott set the first record at over 50 mph average for the lap - in 2009 John McGuinness lapped in 1712.30, an average lap of 131.578mph.  This programme takes the fastest recorded sector times and plays them back to bak to make the 'Perfect Lap'.

The film is an essay in desire using images rather than words. It's like a prose poem, with the intertitles giving it syntax.

This trip would not be a vacation, but rather an opportunity to see what life has to offer by meeting people from different parts of the country, while they work odd jobs along the way. This idea goes against the sensibilities of Howard's parents and Howard's girlfriend, Mary, who see this trip as just another impetuously stupid idea by flaky George.
