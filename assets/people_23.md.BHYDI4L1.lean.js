It is a form of music that is often perceived as cold and lifeless by outsiders, but in the eyes of the artists it is a multifaceted and soulful way of life.  The movie is not an overview of the Finnish Techno scene nor a chronicle. Many of the artists are virtually unknown in Finland, but have a large fanbase outside their home country.

In the 1930s, when Americans longed to escape the grim realities of Depression-era life, four men turned Seabiscuit into a national hero. They were his fabulously wealthy owner Charles Howard, his famously silent and stubborn trainer Tom Smith and the two hard-bitten, gifted jockeys who rode him to glory. By following the paths that brought these four together and in telling the story of Seabiscuit's unlikely career, this film illuminates the precarious economic conditions that defined America in the 1930s and explores the fascinating behind-the-scenes world of thoroughbred racing.

He has lived most of his life in Brooklyn Heights. He has taught until recently at the Polytechnic Institute in Brooklyn, and earlier at San Francisco State, Colgate, Queens College, and the University of Wisconsin. I was born young into a world that was already very old, says Zukofsky. Words for me are solid, he adds, even though sometimes they liquefy and sometimes they aerify.

As Holmes soon deduces, she has good reason to be fearful, though not necessarily from the cyclist.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Die Frauen vom Gnadenstein","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Contre La Famine (Tai Yuan, Shanxi)","tagline":"","description":"Silent film","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/6/0/9/0/0/760900-contre-la-famine-tai-yuan-shanxi--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=6223529669"},{"name":"She Played and Paid","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/8/4/4/9/5/484495-she-played-and-paid-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=dd41fba17c"},{"name":"Such a Girl","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/6/1/3/8/0/361380-such-a-girl-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=a281754fae"},{"name":"Paid in Advance","tagline":"","description":"In the northwestern wilderness of Alaska, an innocent young girl falls into the clutches of a band of evil men of the gold fields.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/3/9/6/9/5/539695-paid-in-advance-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=7645842007"},{"name":"Arima kaibyden","tagline":"","description":"Film about Ghost-Cat.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"America Goes Over","tagline":"","description":"A film produced and distributed by the US Army Signal Corps during World War I to inform and \\"educate\\" the US population about the reasons for fighting the war.
