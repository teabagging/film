With an observational lens, En Ancn ( In Ancon) explores the space of memory to uncover the filmmakers childhood. With distance in time and space, and with the desire to observe and re-examine a place from the past, comes a new gaze and an evolution of thought and awareness.  The separation provides the opportunity of seeing things as they are. With space and time comes clarity. The filmmaker is familiar to this place, but has now grown from being born into this system and with this mentality. Through the nostalgic eyes of adulthood En Ancn sheds light to expose the existing barriers of class segregation that pertain in Peru. It also investigates the process of realizing the system we are in, in order to break off from it, and the process of change as a path to liberation.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Inertia","tagline":"","description":"Experimental film invoving a street.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"I want to have a dream","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/9/8/2/9/3/798293-i-want-to-have-a-dream-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=0274ec36ba"},{"name":"Jacopo e Valentina","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"La casa","tagline":"","description":"A story by Mario Levrero and a mythical house in the Paran Delta (Tigre - Argentina) conspire to shape this film, as two pieces that complement each other but without keeping a total synchronization.

As Ray's uniquely English songwriting style developed, the spectre of Ray and Dave's rocky fraternal relationship continually loomed in the background, through concerts for The Old Grey Whistle Test in the 1970s to appearances on Top of the Pops in the 1980s.  The inevitable band split came in 1996, and the BBC archive continues with Ray's reinvention as a solo artist with performances on the Electric Proms and up to the present day on Later... with Jools Holland.

Four decades later, his relative, Shravan Vidyarthi, found his prints and negatives in Nairobi. Covered in dust and all but forgotten, the 100,000 images that make up his archive trace the short life of one of the most prolific photographers of Africas independence movements in the 1950s and 1960s.  In 2004, Shravan started to retrace Priya Ramrakhas life story, talking to journalists, family and friends and using a handful of images in family collections that would become the basis for his documentary film, African Lens: The Story of Priya Ramrakha.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"AB","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/2/0/0/8/3/120083-ab-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=76d9a55824"},{"name":"Cortesia Y Neumaticos","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/6/2/6/5/6/562656-cortesia-y-neumaticos-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=c9b18c5284"},{"name":"Deus Ex Machina","tagline":"","description":"A librarian is tasked with solving the case of a serial killer.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Exspendable","tagline":"","description":"Police informant Raffy-el thinks he's gotten the upper hand on cops and crooks alike when he obtains a master list of all the snitches the Philadelphia police have working for them.

Like earlier experimental filmmakers, Kirby employs painterly abstraction, the radical condensation of time, and the direct registration of space on the material substrate of the medium. But she almost always uses formal schemas in order to return to the things themselves. Kirby examines the uniqueness, irreducibility, and the emotional ramifications of the particular moment, locating the palpable residues of the everyday. But like later, more systematic filmmakers such as Gehr, Akerman, and Snow, Kirby attends to the larger patterns, repetitions, and reversals that organize both perception and our lived experience.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/6/5/0/2/5/865025-latent-light-excavations-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=99631decc2"},{"name":"Made Backwards","tagline":"","description":"While having lunch, Martin is approached by a young fan of the films he used to write.

There are also five interesting interviews with Eric where he talks about the history of some of the featured songs. These fit in very well between some of the songs, but I don't feel they spoil the continuity and they do not interrupt any songs. Eric performs as his fans would expect - plenty of stage presence and integrity and on the whole he sings extremely well with far less shouting than he has done on some other concert occasions.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/1/3/1/2/2/1013122-eric-burdon-the-new-animals-live-at-the-coach-house-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=221740ef92"},{"name":"La banquise","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/6/0/0/7/8/760078-la-banquise-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=be20943ee5"},{"name":"Sway","tagline":"","description":"A final encounter between an aging woman and her grandson reveals a surprising and intimate past.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Banco de Sangue","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/3/9/4/8/7/1039487-banco-de-sangue-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=deeb5dc833"},{"name":"Banner","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"ѧ֧ѧݧ","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Faith","tagline":"","description":"A short film on the subject of an Arsenal fan's protest and based on an original short story by Fever Pitch author Nick Hornby, starring John Sessions, Saskia Reeves, Gary Lineker and Leslie Grantham.
