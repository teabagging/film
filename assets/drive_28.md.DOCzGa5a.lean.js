Addressed to a generation coming up in an era of protest and social change, where many found themselves increasingly burdened with hopelessness, paranoia, and neurosis, The Palace of Pleasure was offered as a cleansing ritual, a post-Freudian expelling of dammed-up energies that anticipated The Primal Scream. In this video, Stephen Broomer discusses Hofsesss therapeutic ambitions, how the film was composed of Hofsesss earlier films, and the sensual spell of the work, the way in which it commands us to enter into a universal fellowship of touch that circulates, from us to us, through us, to strain the boundaries between the self and the other.","rating":"","theme":"Noir and dark crime dramas","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/1/9/0/0/8/419008-palace-of-pleasure-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=db60207750"},{"name":"Jungle Jitters","tagline":"","description":"Starts out with a tribe of African cannibals imitating Native Americans.
