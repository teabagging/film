Bilwamangal, a resident of Varanasi, was a Sanskrit scholar, who gets infatuated towards a courtesan called Chintamani (Aswathamma), a woman of ill-fame. As a result, he deserts his wife. However, Chintamani is an ardent devotee of Lord Krishna (Serugalathur Sama) and spends most of her time singing bhajans in praise of Lord Krishna. His attraction towards Chintamani eventually draws Bilwamangal closer towards Lord Krishna and transforms his life forever.

Fronted by BBC Asian Network DJ Bobby Friction, the film tells the story of how a simple folk tradition from the wheat fields of north India was transformed in the 1980s to become a unique British club music - outselling many mainstream UK acts.  It's a story of cassette tapes, corner shops and glitter-clad musical heroes, of teenagers bunking off school to attend secret daytime gigs and of generational culture clashes - as this underground scene became as popular among Asians as Wham and Culture Club were to the mainstream.  The film traces the birth of bhangra amid the early Punjabi immigrants in the steel foundries of the West Midlands. It explores its glitzy heyday when, despite selling hundreds of thousands of records, artists remained unknown by the mainstream and failed to make it into the charts.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/2/1/6/7/7/521677-pump-up-the-bhangra-the-sound-of-asian-britain-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=eb6a9bba7c"},{"name":"Revue Starlight 1st StarLive \\"Starry Sky\\" - Documentary","tagline":"","description":"Behind-the-scenes of ShjoKageki Revue Starlight 1st StarLive \\"Starry Sky\\" concert.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/2/9/3/5/8/929358-revue-starlight-1st-starlive-starry-sky-documentary-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=507aede86f"},{"name":"June","tagline":"","description":"A property dispute between two neighbors sheds light on shared hardships.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/7/1/7/1/5/471715-june-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=c3fc403669"},{"name":"Joy of Wolf","tagline":"","description":"A student learns a magic trick.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/4/5/9/6/3/445963-joy-of-wolf-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=d0f8967873"},{"name":"Invalidated","tagline":"The Shredding of the US Patent System","description":"Thrust into a battle to save his invention, inventor Josh Malone uncovers the shocking truth that our patent system is weakening, property rights are at risk and American Innovation is dying!

The film gives a unique and particular view of the world of male prostitution, in the hands of two characters: a mature man who seeks pleasure through the vision of nakedness and the beauty of a young scoundrel.  But the story goes further and makes a reflection on beauty and its loss through the passage of the years, in old age, and as youth is the canon of desired and revered beauty. Young bodies are synonymous with beauty, and the taboos of our society limit the admiration of such young beauty by the elders.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/1/0/2/3/4/710234-david-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=c8ae0b6daf"},{"name":"Remembering Holland","tagline":"","description":"When you look at a river, what do you see? Remembering Holland by Jan Wouter van Reijen carries the viewer through the basin of the River Waal, past painters, sculptors and poets. Van Reijen follows the entire course of the river, from the German border to the North Sea, and creates portraits of various artists who have taken the riverine landscape as their theme. Each and every one of them sings the rivers praises in his or her own way, from extremely realistic to abstract. At every spot along the way, and each day anew, the river landscape changes: we see the water dark and colorful, glistening in late and early light, in morning dew and by moonlight, in clouds of mist and the snows of winter. Yet the water brings more than beauty alone. The flooding of the forelands and the reinforcement of the dykes in 1995 remind us of the eternal struggle of the Dutch against the rising water. See it and be borne along on a voyage of the imagination.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/4/5/7/9/0/245790-remembering-holland-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=37baac99fa"},{"name":"Padly idol: Konspirace Jurije Gagarina","tagline":"","description":"On April 12th, 1961, the Soviet Union reports the successful launch, orbit and reentry of the first man in space, Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin pushing the cold war into a space duel.

A Sunday musician, out-and-out misogynist, talented utterer of curses, lover of the mermaid, seller of beach souvenirs, he left dazzling drawings and major 20th century paintings. At the centre of the film is the creative impotence he experienced halfway through his life. The setting is Ostend, queen of beaches, the city that he never wanted to leave, and the North Sea, beautifully photographed. A film on art which provides outstanding answers to the following questions: how to film a scene, how to find a dramatic structure, how to avoid narratives being too educational. The scenes are shot in full screen: the film imposes its format of continuity and narration on the museological framework.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"La fllire chinoise","tagline":"","description":"Bruce is hired by the CIA and the Chinese police to break up a major international drug ring.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/8/5/4/7/5/285475-la-filiere-chinoise-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=7f236910b2"},{"name":"Stocking Assault Demon Throw it in!","tagline":"","description":"1990 Pink film directed by Satoru Kobayashi.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/2/2/0/3/0/1022030-stocking-assault-demon-throw-it-in--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=a6bdf5a079"},{"name":"Antri Dong","tagline":"","description":"The film tells the story of a middle-class young man named Dendy who is rich and lives in a big house with a driver and a loyal servant.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/9/0/6/3/8/790638-antri-dong-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=63d9559af4"},{"name":"Companion of Caviar","tagline":"","description":"About how Professor Mintz, using a time machine, sent a group of citizens of the city of Guslyar to 1948.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/1/7/9/0/2/817902---0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=2b16cad0d8"},{"name":"El chilar","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/0/3/9/7/7/603977-el-chilar-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=4cf17551e3"},{"name":"Pening Pening Lalat","tagline":"","description":"Zakaria (AR Badul) the interest hunt has shot a young man, Dino and bring it home.
