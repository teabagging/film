Thanks to the judicial pressure on the city hall to clean the pollution from the Riachuelo River (where the most parlous fair is located), it has accelerated a process of transformation of the land that will produce an unexpected negotiation between the government and the fair.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Bedsore","tagline":"","description":"Bedsore; a pain from the press of the body.

On the same day, Winston Churchill became prime minister on 10 May 1940, German forces poured into Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and France. The first few months of his premiership allowed Churchill to display many of the qualities that singled him out as an infamous leader. His force of personality was instrumental in cementing the 'Big Three' Alliance with Britain's powerful allies, Russia and the United States. His memorable speeches strengthened Britain's resolve during the darkest days.

The Dewa Sanzan was once a thriving pilgrimage site, welcoming many new yamabushi each year and worshiped throughout all of Northern Japan. But as the demographic crisis continues in Japan, and younger generations continues to lose interest in these ancient rites; the yamabushi of the Dewa Sanzan struggle to renew their ranks, and the region's culture threatens to disappear.
