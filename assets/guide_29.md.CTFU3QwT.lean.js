Chun (Yu) is a high-class society woman who secretly dabbles in every sort of vice, from arranging murder to kidnapping young girls to serve as sex slaves for her brothel. One such lass is the beautiful Ai-nu, who manages to fight her way out of getting gang raped by Chun's minion. When she is recaptured, she promptly kills one of her first customers. Ai-nu's spunk intrigues Chun, prompting her to not only cover up the lass' crime but also seduce her as well. Detective Ling Yun (Alex Man Chi-leung) soon suspects something is amiss and begins investigating Chun's brothel over the objections of his superiors. When Ai-nu falls for Yun, Chun orders her lackey/lover Yeh to kill him. Instead, he tries to seduce Ai-nu himself. ~ Jonathan Crow, Rovi","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/0/5/4/2/100542-lust-for-love-of-a-chinese-courtesan-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=2cb82bdc2c"},{"name":"Ten Years in an Open Necked Shirt","tagline":"","description":"A portrait of Salford-born poet, storyteller and comic, John Cooper-Clarke.

In 1517, power was in the hands of the few, thought was controlled by the chosen, and common people lived lives without hope. On October 31 of that year, a penniless monk named Martin Luther sparked the revolution that would change everything.  He had no army. In fact, he preached nonviolence so powerfully that  400 years later  Michael King would change his name to Martin Luther King to show solidarity with the original movement.  This movement, the Protestant Reformation, changed Western culture at its core, sparking the drive toward individualism, freedom of religion, women's rights, separation of church and state, and even free public education. Without the Reformation, there would have been no pilgrims, no Puritans, and no America in the way we know it.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/0/7/2/7/0/407270-martin-luther-the-idea-that-changed-the-world-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=95c9b69adc"},{"name":"The Reservoir Game","tagline":"The secret of former president now reveals","description":"An investigative reporter seeks to expose the whereabouts of a slush fund belonging to the former president of South Korea, Lee Myung-bak.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/0/8/8/6/3/408863-the-reservoir-game-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=fa9deba4a2"},{"name":"The Harrowing","tagline":"Fear what's inside you","description":"Accused of the ritualistic murder of his best friend, a vice detective bent on finding the truth is plunged into Hell when he goes undercover and discovers that demons might be real.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/1/3/2/9/0/413290-the-harrowing-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=e91f2b5c21"},{"name":"Nail","tagline":"","description":"A recently divorced man is setting up his new home, while doing so he discovers that the person living on the other side of the wall gets easily upset.
