Throughout their fourteen years of family life, Nadezhda stood by as Stalin transformed from the ordinary revolutionary into the unlimited dictator of Russia - a semi-god, whose portraits replaced Christian orthodox icons in the corners of peasant's huts. One morning she was found dead in her bed, revolver by her side. Up to this day, historians continue the heated debate as to whether she had killed herself or was murdered by Stalin. Tsukerman's film is an attempt to solve the riddles of the not-so-distant past, weaving stories within stories and blending commentary from remaining relatives, friends, and historians with rare archival footage. The film provides a fascinating overview of the early history of the USSR while simultaneously exploring the myriad questions surrounding this complex relationship.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/1/9/8/3/5/219835-stalin-s-wife-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=fbaae319ac"},{"name":"Gigolo","tagline":"","description":"He is young, good-looking and of Arab descent and gets lost amongst the glamour of Paris international jet set.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/6/4/3/5/16435-gigolo-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=debcf950f0"},{"name":"Simple Revenge","tagline":"Nothing is what it seems.","description":"When beautiful Alexandria is denied a promotion a heated argument turns deadly and she frames her boss's husband for the murder.

The Story of Film: An Odyssey is an inclusive and ground-breaking journey through the history of world cinema and a treat for movie lovers around the globe. Guided by filmmaker and historian Mark Cousins, this wonderfully insightful 15-hour love letter to the movies begins with the invention of motion pictures at the end of the 19th century, continuing through the entire 20th century of moviemaking and concluding with the globalized digital industry of the 21st. In The Story of Film: A New Generation, Cousins picks up where Odyssey left off, returning with a new epic and hopeful tale of modern cinematic innovation in the new millennium, exploring how movies and moviegoing have evolved and will continue to transform to our collective joy and wonder.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/6/7/0/4/4/1067044-the-complete-story-of-film-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=e45fefea6f"},{"name":"Expediency","tagline":"","description":"At the beginning of the year, after a revolution, a new political difference took place between an influential figure of a military man and a political party.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/5/7/1/3/8/957138-expediency-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=1b01ac1ea7"},{"name":"Saleem","tagline":"","description":"After being forced to leave everything behind, Saleem, a young boy carrying the burden of his past, stumbles upon a treasure map and embarks on a life-changing adventure!","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/2/5/7/9/6/1025796-saleem-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=531f843cce"},{"name":"Feliz Navidad","tagline":"","description":"If the heart remains the one of a child, is it really that absurd to meet Santa on a Christmas Eve?","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/2/0/5/7/3/1020573-feliz-navidad-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=f7fa24fd4b"},{"name":"Jane Goodall: Reasons for Hope","tagline":"If you are going to do a thing, give it all you have","description":"Jane Goodall-Reasons For hope is an uplifting journey with stories to inspire people to make a difference in the world.

Trapped in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, this group of nearly 80 settlers fell prey to sub-zero temperatures, torrential rainfalls, extreme heat, and ten-foot snow drifts. Punishing storms trapped the party with nearly no food or shelter for 5 months in the Sierra Nevada mountains. Many died, some succumbed to cannibalism to survive, and others delved deeply into their faith while waiting to be rescued. The Donner Party explores this exciting journey through a hybrid of first-person narration, remarkable reenactments, expert interviews, CGI, and archival materials.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/5/4/1/4/5/654145-dead-of-winter-the-donner-party-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=62d64e4268"},{"name":"The Wedding & Bebek Betutu","tagline":"Save the wedding, save the world.","description":"A group of elite hotel staff named The Crew is given an important mission: save the wedding of the owner's daughter.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/9/6/7/1/2/296712-the-wedding-bebek-betutu-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=77d017ef07"},{"name":"8 tiros","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/0/0/2/9/3/300293-8-tiros-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=b7c9341656"},{"name":"Cuckold","tagline":"","description":"When an assistant professor's wife leaves him his life spirals into a world of debauchery, with only the hope of an old friend to save him from ruin.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/8/9/9/7/3/289973-cuckold-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=529cabcfa1"},{"name":"Godzilla: The Return of Spacegodzilla","tagline":"","description":"A short Godzilla fan film, screened at G-Fest.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/3/3/2/5/8/833258-godzilla-the-return-of-spacegodzilla-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=0984ea2693"},{"name":"Wakakozake","tagline":"","description":"Murasaki Wakako is a 26-year-old OL that loves nothing more than delicious food and drink.
