The close succession of the shots, like the use of the reprocessed soundtrack of running water, are all variations on the texture of the aquatic substance. Under the fa?ade of a work far removed from realism, Steina in fact offers a work that is in total contrast with the traditional images of running water, but, with her video vision, comes very close to literary and pictorial visions of romanticism.

This confused mess, the first cinematic attempt at portraying the Greek resistance in WWII, caused quite a stink upon release, as much for its surprising style (recalling that of Bertolt Brecht) as for its subject matter. Reaction to its screening as part of the 1966 Cannes Film Festival's International Critic's Week was heated and divisive, proving Kyrou's later statement by rising above its own inherent silliness to achieve a sort of rarefied critical status.
