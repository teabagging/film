The conductor is Sir Colin Davis, who worked for several years with the cast of this production, resulting in a masterly interweaving of characters in this gripping drama.  Elijah Moshinsky?s production for The Royal Opera was inspired by early Victorian photographs taken of the Suffolk coast and presents his action on a sparse stage, evocatively lit and dominated by strong performances.
