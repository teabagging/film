As an enemy for the masses, he presented his adversary Fethullah Glen, whom he branded as the coup leader. He also urged the imams of the country's mosques to condition the population to resist. And so it happens that at night thousands of agitated people take to the streets to oppose the armed insurgents. The death toll was high. 352 people died across Turkey during the attempted coup.

In the Qilian mountains of Qinghai Province, where the altitude is over 3,600 meters and the air thin, there are numerous small coal mines in which work around 200 miners aged 17 to 50. Every day, they must crawl through pits 60 to 70 metres deep just to carry out 30 loads of coal. Each load weighs 50 kilograms. The miners earn 500 yuan a month, without insurance. Miners normally suffer from pneumoconiosis after working four or five years in the mine and cannot work thereafter. They usually spend their wages on building houses, marriage, and tuition fees for their children. If they die in an accident, their family receives a 5,000 yuan pension. This film is a record of these working conditions, and of human labour.

As far as Resurreccion goes, it is a semi-historical Drama, based on Leo Tolstoy's novel also titled \\"Resurrection\\" . However, Solares' movie loosely uses the start of the 1910 to 1920 Mexican Revolution as its cornerstone, (instead of the Russian battle that Tolstoy relied on for his 1899 literary work ). It essentially documents one man's effort to find redemption for his past sins.
