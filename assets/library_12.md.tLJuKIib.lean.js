SHELTER ME focuses on the success stories to bring more people into the shelters to give these incredible animals a second chance. The first film shows how shelter pets are helping our returning war veterans cope with PTSD. We go inside a women's prison, where inmates train shelter dogs to become service animals for people with disabilities. We also see the journey of two stray dogs, from the day they are picked up on the streets and brought to the shelter until the day they become a beloved family pet.

In his documentary STOP FILMING US (2020), set in the city of Goma in DRC, Dutch filmmaker Joris Postema examined the link between stereotypes and this skewed balance of power. After a screening of STOP FILMING US in Goma, the audience wondered if the film could tell a different story using the same footage. Together with producer Ganza Buroko, filmmakers Bernadette Vivuya and Kagoma Twahirwa re-edited the footage to make a version that better reflects their perspective and does justice to their own experiences.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/3/4/3/2/0/934320-stop-filming-us-but-listen-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=7c7bd8e208"},{"name":"Former POC","tagline":"This is an identity awakening...","description":"A mockumentary following a Brown man who no longer identifies as a person of colour.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/3/9/9/1/6/839916-former-poc-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=8e27388fed"},{"name":"Kk rka","tagline":"","description":"The story takes place in the early 1900s, between the characters of a middle-class love triangle.

But behind the upbeat, frenzied facade of Robin Williams was a sensitive and vulnerable man, deeply plagued by depression and haunted by his demons. Few comedians have ever been as beloved as Robin Williams. His story is full of tragic moments. It inspires us to look past the mask of those people who seem to have a perfect life.

An out-of-print photography book on Portuguese stone pavements leads to a series of improbable connections. A tour of a neurobiology lab leads to an examination of a Cold War re-education camp where prisoners were forced to dig up stones to create replicas of antiquity while covertly drawing on stone shards to mark and then bury a trace of their stories.
