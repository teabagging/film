However, 80 miles from land, the Endurance became locked in impenetrable pack ice. For the next nine months, the crew desperately tried to batter their way back to open water. In 1915, the crew and their sleigh dogs were forced to abandon the Endurance as the pressure of the ice began crushing the ship. The crew was able to row to Elephant Island, where 22 remained, while Shackleton and five others attempted the desperate 800-mile voyage to inhabited South Georgia Island.

In the 90's snowboarding made it's big break through and there were few heroes on skis. The Free Radical group felt it was time to change that. In 1997 the first film about the Free Radicals was produced. The success was a fact and many of the starring riders could get their sponsorship and make a living off freeride skiing. Most of Scandinavia's big names in freeriding have had a sequence in a Free Radicals film, like Henrik Windstedt, Jon Olsson, Kaj Zackrisson, Sverre Liliequist, Jesper R?nnb?ck, etc. 2011 Free Radicals The Sunny Side is the 12th Free Radicals film!","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/2/7/8/1/102781-the-sunny-side-free-radicals-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=65900cde07"},{"name":"Farm","tagline":"","description":"One stormy afternoon, Farmer and his Daughter are visited by an old creature called 'Riker' and It's winged associate.

With a pact to move to Chicago and dive headfirst into the vibrant theatre scene, the future seems bright for this quirky band of friends. Unfortunately, after a year goes by they find they have yet to connect, having gone separate ways, dealing with various \\"day jobs,\\" an oddly intrusive neighbor, or theatre productions gone horribly, and hilariously, wrong.

Die AE2 hatte dabei die Aufgabe, die Dardanellen zu durchqueren und den Trken in den Rcken zu fallen. Die Mission scheiterte.

He was succeeded in 1957 by Jack Paar, a skilled interviewer who got his start in radio and brought the art of conversation to the small screen. Johnny Carson followed as the next and undoubtedly most popular host of the show. He agreed somewhat reluctantly and became a TV staple for the next 30 years. His success led to many others trying their hand at the format, some successfully, including Merv Griffin, Joey Bishop and Dick Cavett.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"֧ߧڧާ֧ߧѧݧߧ ާѧߧ-2000. ֧ܧӧڧ֧  ӧ֧ܧ","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Tunnel Vision","tagline":"","description":"On a regular day, 1,000,000 travelers travel in Stockholm's subway.

All of his playful, engaging work is informed with ideas from literature, philosophy, ethnography and alchemy.  Tilsons early work focussed on mass-market consumerism and politics. But he was soon disenchanted with mechanical methods of production and his art in the 1970s and 1980s employed hand-worked wood and metal in intriguing ways.  Shot in and around the artists studio in Cortona, Italy, this film was produced alongside Joe Tilsons first British retrospective at Londons Royal Academy of Arts.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/7/4/9/3/9/1074939-theeye-joe-tilson-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=ad47fa62fb"},{"name":"theEYE: Karl Weschke","tagline":"","description":"Karl Weschkes impressive, complex paintings picture the human figure and the landscape, the everyday and the mythical. His subjects include dogs and drowned bodies, creatures from legends and, increasingly in recent years, the monumental ruins of ancient Egypt. For more than fifty years, he has explored the possibilities of painting and its relevance to an uncertain world.  Produced alongside a retrospective at Tate St Ives, with additional paintings from British collections, this film profiles the artist in the Cornwall that has been his home since 1955. Filmed in and around his studio and in the coastal landscape that informs all of his work, Weschke speaks engagingly about his rich, remarkable life and about many of his most significant canvases. Like his work, the painter is serious, intense, spare C and yet also with an appealing streak of mischief.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/7/5/3/1/4/1075314-theeye-karl-weschke-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=4e16a56f64"},{"name":"The Handyman","tagline":"Two lost souls cross paths with an unexpected turn","description":"Follows a lonely spinster, who's living on her own on a secluded farm in the mid-west of the USA.
