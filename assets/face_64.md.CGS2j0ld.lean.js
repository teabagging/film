Completed by bassist Jon Sykes and keyboardist Steve Kitch, theyve honed a lean yet lush, quietly timeless sound that soars on It Leads To This.  Comprising eight fat-free epics C mixing rock urgency with delicate atmospherics, pensive keys and captivating melodies C it finds Soord looking back and fearing for the world his children will inherit. His lyrics also drew from literature: accounts of Ancient Rome, John Williams classic Stoner and epistolary Augustus.
