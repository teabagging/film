The concept is inspired by Camillo Leonardi's \\"Speculum Lapidum\\", published in 1533, which describes the magical healing virtues of a variety of stones, categorized by colour. The character-based animated vignettes are inspired by the woodcuts in De Hortus Sanitatis, a natural history encyclopedia published in 1485, which details various methods of harnessing the power of gems. It was believed at the time that a given gem's powers could be absorbed through focused viewing. Proposing an analogy between this belief and attraction to cinema, this film offers audiences an opportunity to absorb the depicted stones energies by viewing their images. The title, Somnium Lapidum, or Dream Stones, is a reference to the imaginative content of the Speculum Lapidum and the dreamlike experience of cinematic viewership.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/8/6/9/6/3/1086963-somnium-lapidum-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=c7adfdd42e"},{"name":"The Field in Paul Where The Sun Goes to Bed Each Night","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Which Way is China","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/2/0/6/9/1/1120691-which-way-is-china-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=39e21385de"},{"name":"Com As Horas Contadas","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/4/3/5/5/8/743558-com-as-horas-contadas-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=e42eb649bd"},{"name":"Blues for Life","tagline":"Do you believe in family?","description":"A young singer, played by Diamond of Crime Mob, finds to a shady blues label, blues for life.

By sharing personal stories, street newspapers attach lives, faces and hearts to the idea of homelessness. These publications allow a bridge connecting the gap between the very poor and the rest of society by helping them understand the issues that concern homeless individuals. For many homeless people, this opportunity gives them a chance to get back on their feet and the real possibility of securing housing.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/3/3/1/2/7/233127-street-paper-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=f780183067"},{"name":"Theatre of Dreams","tagline":"","description":"Documentary about the Therapeutic Theatre Group of Julio de Matos' Psychiatric Hospital.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/1/5/0/1/4/615014-theatre-of-dreams-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=65f9828ec0"},{"name":"Time and Tide Wait for No Man: A Touch of King Hu","tagline":"","description":"A documentary on King Hu.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/4/7/7/4/9/1047749-time-won-t-wait-for-me-king-hu-in-taiwan-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=c6733895ff"},{"name":"Warrior","tagline":"","description":"Chinese movie","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/4/9/3/5/6/1049356-warrior-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=5be7c62e1e"},{"name":"ާ-ݧݧ  ݧ ݧ֧ҧߧڧܧ","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/5/0/3/8/4/550384---0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=85a2fa6c37"},{"name":"The Art Patron","tagline":"","description":"A young wealthy art patron goes on a quest to find the perfect painting to add to her collection.

With the construction of a new road, however, the valley was left vulnerable to the outside world. Since then, the younger generation has rejected the age-old wisdom and practices of the Amchi, embracing more modern, lucrative activities instead.
