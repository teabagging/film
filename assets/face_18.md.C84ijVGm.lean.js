The animal was apprehended by the Egyptian authorities on suspicion of espionage. The would-be spying device on the stork was later shown to be a scientific tracking device used by Hungarian scientists to follow the storks migratory patterns.  In its footage of birds flocking or perched alone, the film resonates with contemporary political tensions between individualism and crowds, and questions whether birds of a feather really do flock together. The work also considers what it would look like to take literally the dubious narratives constructed by repressive governments, and the flocks of paranoia and conspiratorial thinking that thus arise.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/9/7/0/7/1/697071-as-birds-flying-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=3e03dffea8"},{"name":"Ascension","tagline":"","description":"Emma dies and ascends.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/7/8/9/1/9/678919-ascension-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=8db5c26284"},{"name":"Ashes To Ashes","tagline":"Daddy's dead, pity the children","description":"The Barton family wasn't prepared for an assault with the supernatural when they purchased the abandoned tavern at the edge of town.

Mothers, sisters, daughters and nieces out of four generations give an account which illuminates the changes which occurred in Egyptian society regarding education and emancipation and the role religion is assigned to in that context. The women's traditional religiosity that formed rather a subtext of their daily life starts to become institutionalized to the extent that life of the younger women became entirely centered on the church and its multiple activities. The film touches on the one hand on the rich mythological Coptic heritages which are rooted among others in Old Egyptian customs and beliefs and tackles on the other gender inequalities perpetuated by the Coptic church and backed by Egyptian society in general.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Mountain Heart","tagline":"","description":"Mountain Heart explores the themes of isolation and ecological extinction through a series of oblique vignettes that build to a denouement both sad and tentatively uplifting.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Moura Encantada","tagline":"","description":"A 1985 Portuguese language drama film directed by Manuel Costa e Silva, starring Luis Varela, Teresa Goucho and Vitorino Salom.

Conceived for the greatest voices of the time, the opera requires an exceptional cast: three prima donna sopranos, an alto, two tenors, and four baritones and basses have leading roles.
