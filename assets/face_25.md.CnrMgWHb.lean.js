Since the 18th century, companies tried to establish mining operations there, but none succeeded: they were driven away by typhoons, landslides or low-profit margins. Ultimately the site was left for the locals. Though mining needs a licence, not having one doesnt stop gold divers from doing their job. Nor do the immense risks diving poses to their health and the environment. Many divers suffer from decompression sickness, which sometimes leads to death. In the meantime, multiple tunnels they dig in the ocean floor in search of gold nuggets cause landslides. Still, it is the only way for the locals to earn enough for a daily serving of rice.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Χͷ","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/1/9/8/7/6/819876--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=a75950a6f5"},{"name":"Last Call For Us","tagline":"","description":"After contemplating suicide, a man calls his wife one last time where we discover that all is not what it seems in their relationship.
