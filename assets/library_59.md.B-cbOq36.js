When she was a small child, she was in an accident that resulted in a young boy being permanently scarred between his eyes while she emerged unscathed. The young boy saved her life and although she never knew who he was, she never forgot him.  Meet Taiga Makoto, a young man with a scar between his eyes who has had a rough life, but has emerged as a rough, tough bully - a thug and a brawler and about as rude as they come - all of which he blames on the incident that gave him his scar.  When Ai and Makoto run into each other again, Ai feels guilt for what Makoto has become and decides to intervene and rehabilitate him. But is he a diamond in the rough, or just a bully?","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/7/6/6/5/97665-the-legend-of-love-sincerity-conclusion-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=7600ee0625"},{"name":"Orpheus and Eurydice","tagline":"","description":"Orpheus' song tames scales and dolphins, dictates laws to the wind and sets the rhythm of the oars that move the sea.

In Mediolanum Magnaghi sought the abstract. He isolated strong, essential architectural features without needing to recompose them in descriptions but making a show of them in temporal, desired luminous contrast. He provoked abstraction with rapid panoramas, but above all with bold, as well as oblique, camera positions. He was more redundant than Ivens or Vigo, perhaps without knowing their work. But he was attentive above all to form, since the human figure is always present in the background. The result is a real harmonic symphony of luminous contrasts, which are also fragmented glimpses of a great city.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/0/9/0/5/8/409058-mediolanum-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=3e637b1be6"},{"name":"Whacks Museum","tagline":"","description":"A Columbia Krazy Kat cartoon released September 29, 1933.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/5/4/0/5/4/254054-whacks-museum-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=069df66590"},{"name":"The Wrecker","tagline":"What did Chuck Regan do when he swung perilously above his former wife and hated rival, almost completely buried under the debris of an earthquake---their lives in his hands---when he knew that their death meant the return of his child?","description":"The Wrecker is a flinty-eyed demolition engineer named Regan (Jack Holt).
