Today few remain. Filmmaker Michael Dominic takes his camera behind the doors of the Sunshine Hotel, one of the few remaining affordable refuges for the destitute and out of luck, a world that has seemingly stood still for more than eight decades. Here the hotel residents live in tiny four-by-six-foot cubicles crowned by a ceiling of chicken wire. Focusing on several of the Sunshines denizens C including a transgender woman saving all her money for additional surgeries and a hotel manager who doubles as its resident philosopher C Dominic presents a non-judgmental snapshot of a diverse group of characters as memorable as the characters at Harry Hopes bar in Eugene ONeills The Iceman Cometh.","rating":"3.62","theme":"Thrillers and murder mysteries","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/8/6/6/7/7/286677-sunshine-hotel-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=67ed3c756f"},{"name":"Exit West","tagline":"","description":"The feature adaptation of the novel which tackles the global refugee crisis and takes place in an unidentified country in the Middle East, where young Saeed and burqa-wearing Nadia flee their home after Saeeds mother is killed by a stray bullet stemming from violent clashes between guerrillas and the local government. The couple joins other migrants traveling to safer havens via carefully guarded doors. Through one door, they wind up in a crowded camp on the Greek Island of Mykonos. Through another, they secure a private room in an abandoned London mansion populated mostly by displaced Nigerians. A third door takes them to Californias Marin County. In each location, their relationship is tested by their struggle to find food, adequate shelter and a sense of belonging among emigrant communities. The allegorical tale shows the contrast between the migrants tenuous daily reality and that of the privileged native population whod prefer that they disappear.","rating":"","theme":"Violent action, guns, and crime","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/0/5/2/7/3/605273-exit-west-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=c3a047c4bb"},{"name":"Broken Oath","tagline":"","description":"Lotus never had a chance.
