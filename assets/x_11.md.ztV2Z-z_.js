The film was made in France by post World War II Ukrainian emigres. It is an ultra low budget movie  -  effort of Borys Dniprowyj. In 1951, Dniprowyj somehow obtained a fair quantity of color film and decided to do something about it. The result is a screen version of Natalka Poltavka which is an ultra rarity today and unseen since the 1950s. Filming took place outside of Paris, France on land acquired by Ukrainian pensioners. This land resembled the steppes of Ukraine. Natalka Poltavka was filmed entirely as a silent movie in 1953. Sometime later in 1953, sound was added to the movie when Dniprowyj was able to make use of the sound recording equipment in a Paris studio. The final product was amateurish. The sound was added poorly to the film during post-production resulting in a somewhat out-of-sync final product that resembles dubbing of a foreign film.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/9/3/9/4/0/1093940-natalka-poltavka-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=54e031af9c"},{"name":"O Brasil nas Naes Unidas","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Victim","tagline":"","description":"Mangsa / Victim / K.

In this film, two Aboriginal spokespersons - Barbara Shaw from the Mount Nancy Town Camp, Alice Springs, and Richard Downs from the Alyawarr Nation - give their views on the effect of the legislation over its first two years of operation. Their stories are accompanied by archival footage and news broadcasts of key moments in the history of the Intervention.

Mascagni might well have taken for his own Puccini's famous quip, Against everything and everyone, make a work from melody. And in Iris it is melodic invention which shows the composer's genius at its greatest. A melody by Mascagni is usually long, smooth and Italian-sounding; and Iris is full-on melody all the way, particularly in such crowd-pleasers as Jor's Serenade, the Hymn of the Sun or the duet in Act II Oh come al tuo sottile corpo s'aggira, which includes the famous Piovra. Furtheremore, with a little effort listeners can identify what would be the various musical numbers.
