In the face of this new reality that made the question of the Occupied Territories the single most pressing issue of the time, the Jerusalem Film Festival went ahead and commissioned the following project.

He made early films like The Bad and the Beautiful (1967) and the Tenth Legion (1967), and then he would re-edit them into other films later. But he wouldnt preserve any copies of the originals, which would then cease to exist. I did the same thing.  The Diaries was an attempt to reshape material thats in my early films; I decided to go into the cutting room and just put the stuff together. Its really all of the key moments, I think, from all of the films that I no longer felt were individual entities or didnt deserve to be, or werent strong enough, compiled into two reels. I edited it around 1976.
