We're told there is no alternative to cuts, privatisation, hunger and homelessness. The Bolivarian Revolution illustrates what can be achieved when governments and people working together, put human need before capitalist profits. Despite Chavez's death in 2013, the process is being built every day by President Maduro and millions of Venezuelans working to create a society built on collective socialist organisation and production.  Venezuela provides an inspiring example of how the fight against austerity can develop into a fight for socialism. This film takes you on that journey through the barrios, universities and workplaces to meet the political activists, students and workers who are changing their future. Alongside the achievements of socialist Cuba, Venezuela shows that not only is another world possible, but this world is being built today in Latin America.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/4/3/9/0/0/943900-viva-venezuela-fighting-for-socialism-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=5554f83e18"},{"name":"Viva Vdeo!","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Vocal Giants and Beyond with Beverley Knight and James Morrison","tagline":"","description":"Beverley Knight and James Morrison select their all-time favourite vocalists in a playlist packed with some of the world's greatest singers.

He influenced the pop music of the 1960s and 1970s, from the Beatles to Pink Floyd, and up to the DJs of the 1990s. He is the author of an absolute hit: the electronic jerks composed with Michel Colombier for the 'Messe pour present time' created by Maurice Bjart in 1967. But above all he is the creator of a prolific work, from the end of the 1940s to the 2010s, where pure and incredible sound experiences coexist with musical settings of texts to constitute mock operas of a new genre.

The first question Michael answered was: I have a question about the attitude (bhavana) one should hold when conducting self-investigation. There are 2 different ideas I can read in Bhagwan's teachings:  The first being \\"Investigating the Self as I\\" or \\"Who am I\\" or \\"What am I\\" or \\"I am I\\". The second is \\"God is I\\" or \\"Bhagwan is shining as I\\" or \\"I am Brahman\\" They both lead to attention on the self, but the feeling is subtly different. The first one is more analytical, and driven by a curiosity. The second one devotional, and is driven by a longing to be one with Bhagwan. I understand that these ultimately the same path, but to me these carry subtly different perfumes.

La Tumba Mambi is a docu-fiction film based on the Tumba Francesa, La Caridad de Oriente, which is located in the city of Santiago de Cuba. Through the Society's youngest member, Flavio, who is collecting information about the Tumba Francesa for a school project, we meet his grand-mother Andrea and mother Queli, two charismatic knowledge keepers of their rich cultural traditions. The original film soundtrack composed and produced by Cuban based DJ Jige, in collaboration with Tumba Francesa members, is a rhythmic and striking reminder that the present is grounded in a history of struggles for freedom.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/2/0/4/2/8/1120428-tumba-mambi-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=7357f4d290"},{"name":"Mijn Turkse stem","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/1/1/1/1/8/1011118-mijn-turkse-stem-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=2d73575c7d"},{"name":"Patterned Dreams","tagline":"","description":"Patterned Dreams, is an abstracted meditation involving a series of introspective dream sequences that searches for meaning among the stars.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/1/3/9/1/1/1013911-patterned-dreams-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=e7fdb7b708"},{"name":"Sternenkind","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/1/8/9/3/9/1118939-sternenkind-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=873d9de101"},{"name":"Thirteen Portraits for Future Reference","tagline":"","description":"A documentary of Gabriel Tremblay's family told in thirteen chapters.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Unexpected","tagline":"","description":"Animation by Nelli Yaskula","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"The Way to a Man's Heart","tagline":"","description":"The animated puppet film ?the way to a man's heart\\" tells the story of a dog who falls in love with a single gentleman.

Snowboarding in the backcountry is an entirely different sport than snowboarding at a resort. A rider gets only a fraction of the runs because they have to earn every foot of ascent. But when taking on these extra challenges ones could be rewarded with the best deep-powder snowboarding that nature has to offer; you won't find these conditions at a ski resort.
