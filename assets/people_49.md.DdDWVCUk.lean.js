If the marriage turned abusive it was almost impossible to escape. Worse still was the fate of unmarried mothers. Improving the lot of all women could only be achieved through political representation.  This representation came about through the vision and hard work of five remarkable women - Caroline Dexter, Henrietta Dugdale, Louisa Lawson, Mary Lee and Vida Goldstein. With their comrades, they would carry the flag over half a century until a newly federated Australia could claim its title as a uniquely democratic nation, but their stories were not without personal trials and crushing setbacks.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"The Presumption of Justice","tagline":"","description":"Through the socio-political overview of the problematic structure of fan clubs and football supporters in Serbia, this movie focuses on a particular case of an incident involving a French citizen - football fan in Belgrade, which led to 12 young people being convicted to 240 years of prison.

This video is composed of the lines that are formed at the points where the surface of the flowing water comes in contact with the walls of those waterways. I have put moving images of ten different lines, each taken from a different area, in a row on the screen. By arranging them in this way we can compare the color, shape, sound, texture and speed of adjacent lines. This composite video image communicates both the diversity of expression and liveliness of the water as it follows the man-made course.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/4/0/7/4/4/240744-the-stream-2-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=185ad876fd"},{"name":"Rosamunde Pilcher: Shades of Love-The Scandal","tagline":"","description":"Laura Aird becomes a successful publishing executive, returning from America and moving to London.

Seventeen years on, they are more statuesque than sexy, but both give larger-than-life performances that contain moments of completely thrilling vocalism. The casting is very strong, with the exception of Justino Diaz's Nelusko, which has strong presence but not much vocal allure. As Inez, Vasco da Gama's fiancee and rival for Shirley Verrett, Ruth Ann Swneson sings with great beauty and has impressive stage presence, very much holding her own in the confrontation with Verrett in the last act. Domingo is refulgent of tone and dramatically convincing, and he and Verrett strike sparks. She really comes into her own in one of the most preposterous mad-scenes in all opera, where she is slowly poisoned by the scent of a giant tree, contriving to make this dramatically truthful and even moving.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/1/8/5/4/101854-meyerbeer-l-africaine-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=b7c7f1e780"},{"name":"On the Record","tagline":"","description":"Titles, a crocodile crossed with Big Ben roams the UK.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/3/4/4/4/0/1034440-on-the-record-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=eefa723c76"},{"name":"The Price of Honesty","tagline":"","description":"American adventurer accidentally got caught up in a multi-million diamond mining at Semarang, Indonesia.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/5/5/5/8/7/1055587-the-price-of-honesty-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=ddefb1af0a"},{"name":"Golf Before Dawn","tagline":"","description":"Comedy film.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/5/4/5/5/5/654555-golf-before-dawn-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=22ad45cd68"},{"name":"Rock'n' Roll","tagline":"","description":"In 1987, a Berlin couple hits the small stage with rock'n'roll - petticoat, stripped socks, ducktail and all.

Britain has a long, colourful and complicated history of having a diverse exotic pet trade; from the days of the old British Empire, until the mid-20th century, it was deemed an indicator and symbol of status, wealth and fashion to own exotic pets, (especially big cats). Incidents and reports spiralled out of control in the 1960s; and with the later introduction of the Dangerous Wild Animals Act in 1976, the situation only intensified, as some exotic cat owners who were unable to afford the new licences required to legally retain their pets, set about deliberately releasing their privately owned big cats in preference of having them terminated. Reports and sightings of big cats in Britain continue to this day.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/1/8/4/3/7/918437-panthera-britannia-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=c14094303f"},{"name":"(Re)Counting (Wo)Man","tagline":"","description":"As they traverse Indigeneity, queerness, and anti-Black racism, an African Indigenous Two Spirit stitches traditional strategies for survival.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Soon to Be a Zombie","tagline":"","description":"Remi is an underground idol hoping to be famous but, with her ordinary face, she hardly gains popularity.
