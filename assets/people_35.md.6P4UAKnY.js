For once the faithful consort of a desaparecido wins her battle against a treacherous tyrant, and the collective joy truly is nameless, as is sung on the stage.

One becomes obsessed with the other and simultaneously imagines an idealized love while the other wants her to find the revolutionary part of herself. Revolution of Everyday Life is a document of actresses playing actresses who play characters that fall in love. It is at the same time a love story that happens in the realm of fiction and in the realm of recorded reality. The result is a documentary film within a fictional one. The film becomes a site not for representation but discovery. It is a structure for things to happen, it becomes the site for performing, not acting, not re-presenting desire, but to enact it - it is a longing for politic of desire and an expression of its urgency.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/3/9/1/6/8/239168-the-revolution-of-everyday-life-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=45e45ad950"},{"name":"Timeless: The Composer/Arranger Series (Arthur Verocai)","tagline":"37 years after its release Arthur Verocai conducts his Opus in front of an audience for the very first time.","description":"Folk-jazz composer/arranger Arthur Verocai was born in Rio de Janeiro. He has created challenging arragements and compositions for Brazilian artists Jorge Ben, Ivan Lins, Leny Andrade and Gal Costa. In 1972 Verocai recorded a self-titled solo LP. It is a stunningly innovative effort. It puts Verocai into a rarified field with the heavy string oriented music of Charles Stepney, David Axelrod and Frank Zappa. Released in a period marked by the Brazilian military government, the album fared poorly. Following its re-issue in 2003, the album has become a highly influential oft sampled classic (see Ludacris, MF Doom and Little Brother). The performance of this seminal 1972 record in its entirety brought the capacity Luckmann crowd to a stand still. According to Verocai, 'he had never played the record, alive or dead!' His delight can be seen on the DVD. The music has been mixed by Verocai himself in Rio. History turned on its head and musical justice served.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/4/8/6/4/8/448648-timeless-the-composer-arranger-series-arthur-verocai--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=5528563c2d"},{"name":"Peter J?back: Jag kommer hem igen till jul - Live fr?n Globen","tagline":"Christmas Concert from Globe Arena in Stockholm 2009","description":"A christmas concert with Peter J?back recorded at Globen in Stockholm","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/2/5/1/7/2/425172-peter-joback-jag-kommer-hem-igen-till-jul-live-fran-globe-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=b81571952a"},{"name":"Our Fantastic 21st Century","tagline":"","description":"2009 film","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/6/7/2/4/7/567247-our-fantastic-21st-century-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=2add1946de"},{"name":"Klick ins Herz","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/8/1/4/5/88145-klick-ins-herz-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=94b94ef382"},{"name":"Mash? shizakari chijo: Jukuniku no izanai","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/7/0/1/8/9/970189-masho-shizakari-chijo-jukuniku-no-izanai-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=20835c7429"},{"name":"Mero Euta Saathi Chha","tagline":"","description":"Jay, who is the heir to the property, is raised by his grandparents after the death of his parents.

There is a startling dynamic energy, which contrasts powerfully with the more restrained interpretations by singers such as Emma Kirkby. Bartoli's natural Italian and the live atmosphere of Maria Grazia d'Alessio's oboe gives her interpretation of the quietly haunting and melodically rich \\"Non ti Lusinghi la Crudeltade\\" from Tito Manlio a particular piquancy.
