Hai Sheng, a young man from Taiwan, was deeply influenced by Japanese militarism. He enthusiastically joined the Japanese vanguard and went to the mainland China to participate in the war together with his foster-brother, Yamamoto Ichiro. However, when he witnessed the atrocities of the Japanese army killing Chinese civilians, he only wanted to escape back to his hometown. On the way back home, Hai Sheng met four girls including Ning Yu. Forced by desperation, Hai Sheng agreed to send them to the occupied Nanjing city. Along the way, Hai Sheng not only had to protect the four girls, but also avoided the pursuit of Yamamoto Ichiro, the captain of the vanguard team. In the end, among the four girls, only Sakurako (Ying Zi), who was of Japanese descent, survived. When Ying Zi also saw the true face of the Japanese soldiers, Hai Sheng decided to work hard to cover Ying Zi to break out of the Japanese army camp.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/2/5/1/5/0/425150--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=1ecc225b07"},{"name":"Last Will and Embezzlement","tagline":"","description":"\\"Last Will and Embezzlement\\" is a feature-length documentary which examines the financial exploitation of the elderly.

Of all the illegal and illicit enterprises in the world, elder exploitation is among the safest and most lucrative. It is a criminal's dream. It carries the least amount of risk, requires minimal outlay, can be done right from your living room, is virtually unreported by its victims - and then, even when it IS reported, it's perpetrators are practically never prosecuted.

So what is going on? Has Einstein's famous theory of relativity finally met its match? Will we one day be able to travel into the past or even into another universe?  In this film, Professor Marcus du Sautoy explores one of the most dramatic scientific announcements for a generation. In clear, simple language he tells the story of the science we thought we knew, how it is being challenged, and why it matters.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/1/9/1/6/5/419165-faster-than-the-speed-of-light--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=8e673782d1"},{"name":"L'Anne des Guignols - La Sextape des Guignols","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/9/2/5/8/2/192582-l-annee-des-guignols-la-sextape-des-guignols-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=17fcfaae7d"},{"name":"Written in Ink","tagline":"","description":"The main protagonist is a homeless, alcoholic living in the dregs of society.

Here was a period that would see amongst other events; civil war, a great plague, the fire of London, the abolition and re-introduction of the monarchy and the gunpowder plot. James I and Charles I ruled until 1649 when Parliament took over during an eleven year period which came to be known as the Commonwealth and Protectorate. The monarchy was finally restored in 1660 with the crowning of Charles II, he was followed by James II, William III and Mary II and finally in 1702 by Queen Anne.  1714 brought England a new royal line with the coronation of George I and so ended another turbulent chapter of England's royal history. With expert analysis from Alan Ereira and atmospheric period reconstructions this programme is an interesting and informative record of the Stuart years.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/0/4/0/3/3/904033-the-kings-and-queens-of-england-the-stuarts-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=606e82552a"},{"name":"On All Floors","tagline":"","description":"A dark comedy which tells the story of five people who are trapped in a falling elevator.

The early hits are here, in rousing and intimate interpretations: Cherry, Cherry, Song Sung Blue, Sweet Caroline, I Am...I Said, Cracklin Rosie, and more. But Neil also introduces songs from what was then his new album - and is now considered a classic - the benchmark Beautiful Noise, produced by rocker Robbie Robertson. And Neil gets across the footlights, bringing the big audience to its feet, inciting clapping and singing along, and pulling two of the best-known stars of the era, singer Helen Reddy and the actor Henry Winkler (then an icon as TVs Fonzie) up on stage to sing with him.

The flames die away and the old man looks around for something to put on the fire. In the end he sacrifices the chair, but soon that too is burnt up. The man tears the remnants of posters from the walls, gathers various rags and throws everything into the stove. Then he takes an axe and gradually chops up the wooden walls of his house, although it is obvious that he cannot win this duel with cruel nature. The fire gradually eats up the planks and beams until the cabin entirely collapses. The man wants to get warm, and so runs around the dying flames.

Smog wasn't just nasty and disruptive, it took its toll on buildings, the economy, child development and adult health - and it was a killer, claiming scores of lives every year.  By 1937, the battle against smog was already being waged: the film points to processing technology to convert raw coal into oil or smokeless fuel, the increasing use of cleaner energy from gas and electricity, and improved housing. But another 15 years of periodic outbreaks of smog still lay ahead, before London's Great Smog of 1952 finally spurred Parliament into action in the form of the Clean Air Act of 1956.  -BFI","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/7/6/4/2/1/1076421-the-smoke-menace-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=8be22428c5"},{"name":"Scrappy's Band Concert","tagline":"","description":"Scrappy is a young band leader; other little boys make up his band.
