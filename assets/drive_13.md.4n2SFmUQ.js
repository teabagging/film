Kuni (Kenichi Endo) runs a Phone Sex service, where middle-aged men talk too,  and arrange to meet, schoolgirls for Compensated Dating (enjo kosai) C the men provide gifts in return for dating the schoolgirl (although no money changes hands, this is effectively teenage prostitution). Kuni discovers that one group of schoolgirls are using his service to ambush (and then blackmail) his clients and decides to embark on a moral crusade against them (hence the title, Stop the Bitch). Unfortunately, this crusade takes the form of arranging to meet the schoolgirls, having (kinky and degrading) sex with them and then running off without paying. The logic goes that if these girls are not making money from their dating, they will give it up, making the world a safer place for everyone.  Unfortunately for Kuni, these schoolgirls decide to fight back.","rating":"","theme":"Lavish dramas and sumptuous royalty","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/2/9/8/8/72988-stop-the-bitch-campaign-version-2-0-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=f08a4d4f07"},{"name":"Saint Death","tagline":"","description":"In Mexico there is a cult that is rapidly growing- the cult of Saint Death.

This film describes the genesis of the \\"Hitchbook\\" and throws light on the strange friendship between two completely different men.
