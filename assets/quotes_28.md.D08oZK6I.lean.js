Come climb the steps that are such important parts of so many area neighborhoods, run around Regent Square, and sample all the sidewalk food at Bloomfield's Italian Days.

Integrating semiology and mass media imagery, he employed such strategies as appropriation, deconstruction, decontextualization, sequentiality, and text/image juxtaposition. With an ironic wit, Baldessari's work considers the gathering, sorting, and reorganizing of information.  Something that is part of my personality is seeing the world slightly askew. Its a perceptual stance. The real world is absurd sometimes, so I dont make a conscious attempt, but because I come at it in a certain way, it seems really strange, Baldessari says in this interview with Nancy Bowen.
