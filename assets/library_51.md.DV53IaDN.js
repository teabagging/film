But, few consider the effect it has on those whose actual job is to terminate a lifethe executioners themselves. Delving deeply into the spiritual, psychological, and philosophical dichotomies within and surrounding capital punishment, director Patty Dillon portrays an emotional journey inside execution through firsthand accounts. From a man of God to men trained to protect lives suddenly required to take them, paths intersect as they discover freedom from their own personal prisons. And, although we tend not to humanize executioners, these men reveal to us emotional conflicts and scars related to a job they never sought, but now accept. We not only glimpse inside prison walls, but also inside the heads of complex men who can't help but question the meaning of life in a way that few of us can even fathom. - Sandy Wolf","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/5/3/6/4/9/253649-there-will-be-no-stay-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=32dd46274f"},{"name":"La vieja escuela","tagline":"","description":"Rodrigo Camarena, the successful CEO of a sports streaming company, invites his high school friends out of town for the weekend to participate in a video game tournament; the prize will reveal the participants' true intentions.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/9/6/1/1/0/596110-la-vieja-escuela-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=3e3729f8a9"},{"name":"Churchill:  100 Days That Saved Britain","tagline":"","description":"Churchill: 100 Days That Saved Britain brings to life letters, diaries, speeches and personal testimony to depict the months of May, June and July 1940.

Singing their way into the hearts, minds and soul of a divided nation in the midst of a civil war, they promoted a peaceful transition to democracy and went on to become Mandela's face of the new nation. When Voices Meet documents the trials, tribulations and triumphs of those musician activists and young choir members.
