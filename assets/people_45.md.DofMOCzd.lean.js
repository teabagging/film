On the largest plain lies the country's largest freshwater lake, Lake Biwa, which is not at all far from Japan's ancient, capital city of Kyoto. The slopes that stretch down towards the lake have been terraced. Here rice seedlings need shallow water in which to grow, and the neat, meticulously constructed paddy fields provide just this. Some of them have been cultivated continuously for thousands of years. Alongside them stand patches of woodland where, for centuries, the people have found their fuel and their food. This is a land that has been touched by people, yet the people tread lightly upon it. It's a land that has been ruled for centuries by the demands of the rice, yet it's still dominated by the rhythmic cycle of the seasons. Here is a landscape that the Japanese people hold so close to their hearts that they have a special word for it: Satoyama.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/9/2/6/4/4/992644-satoyama-i-japan-s-secret-watergarden-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=ccf6c7492b"},{"name":"The Hip Hop Years","tagline":"","description":"The Hip Hop Years is a three part series of one hour television documentaries, made for Channel 4 in 1999.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/7/7/3/5/0/777350-the-hip-hop-years-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=fff6d40920"},{"name":"Johan van der Keuken","tagline":"","description":"Precise portrait of the Dutch film-maker best known internationally - apart from Paul Verhoeven.

The railroad, laid over the rubble of the Second World War, damaged during the Bosnian War, and neglected in the new millennium now looks like the ruins of some ancient civilization.
