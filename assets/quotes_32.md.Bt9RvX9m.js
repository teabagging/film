Although the main plot has been kept unrevealed to keep the suspense and maintain the surprise element but overall it is a story about a women's wrong choice in life and the difficulties she faces to come to terms with and to overcome these challenges. The film is able to bring forward a social issue, challenging the stereotypes on women hood and its boundaries. In a nutshell it is a complete family entertainment package with romance, hatred, friendship, humor and action with an underlining social message.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/2/4/1/0/7/424107-karkhana-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=c5b7a32ae8"},{"name":"South africa","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/9/5/3/5/3/895353-south-africa-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=9f9d4f4951"},{"name":"Veham(illusion) or The ignored silence of words","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Alaleh","tagline":"I wish I didn't remember all these forty years like this.","description":"This film reviews the ups and downs of a woman named Alala from childhood to the age of 45.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/8/2/9/1/7/982917-alaleh-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=31e5de47b8"},{"name":"Weedland","tagline":"Please Remember to Tip Your Driver","description":"Budding lawyer Cecilia finds herself screwed by her husband's \\"legal,\\" medical marijuana delivery service, triggering herself and ex-employee, Guillermo to retaliate with a marijuana delivery service of their own.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/2/4/0/8/7/424087-weedland-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=a71ed9d296"},{"name":"Bounty","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/8/1/0/0/4/481004-bounty-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=19e192751e"},{"name":"Espa?a desconocida","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/5/0/2/4/3/650243-espana-desconocida-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=3eda2e5948"},{"name":"PUR - Die Geschichte einer Band","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/5/7/6/1/2/457612-pur-die-geschichte-einer-band-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=5f8450391c"},{"name":"The Crab","tagline":"","description":"This movie is crafted to raise cancer prevention and awareness in Kerala.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/9/6/8/1/8/396818-the-crab-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=c254162f86"},{"name":"Return to Form","tagline":"","description":"Emma feels responsible for the accident that caused her mother's death.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/0/3/8/6/2/603862-return-to-form-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=6d01d28098"},{"name":"Carne y Arena","tagline":"Virtually present, Physically invisible","description":"Based on true accounts, the superficial lines between subject and bystander are blurred and bound together, allowing individuals to walk in a vast space and thoroughly live a fragment of the refugees' personal journeys.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/8/3/2/4/8/1183248-carne-y-arena-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=c39ede4a7d"},{"name":"Tottenham Hotspur: The Lane","tagline":"","description":"A history of Tottenham Hotspurs world famous home, White Hart Lane, before being torn down to be replaced by a brand new 60000 all seater stadium.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/1/6/9/3/5/616935-tottenham-hotspur-the-lane-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=dee201e70c"},{"name":"һ","tagline":"","description":"A young layabout who's more interested in gaming than paying his bills on time receives a mysterious magic box that could bring about endless wealth or his untimely demise.

Here the young priest's son walked from Ku Klux Klan and murderers to the blacks at the bottom of the American dream. Jacob's approach to life led him into the struggle to transform racism hatred into love between people. But what inner demons drove the vagabond from place to place? We see Jacob when he confronts the sins of the past and clears up. It is embarrassing when long forgotten secrets are revealed; it is intoxicating when old flames suddenly ignite in glowing passion; It's brutal when death reaps in the garden of love.

In his life champagne flowed like water, trips to Vegas, New York, and Los Angeles were the norm, and $150,000 shopping sprees were nothing.

This man is Rayful Edmond III. In the media's eyes he was guilty until proven innocent, but in the streets eyes he was a hero who made it to the top.
