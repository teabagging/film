This gave the student movement political legitimacy and it spread outside Beijing.  The Red Guards started to attack the Four Olds and marched across China to eradicate old ideas, old cultures, old customs and old habits.  Ultimately the struggle between different Red Guard factions led to a chaotic civil-war-like situation. During 1967-68 the Peoples Liberation Army got the movement under control and restored social order.

Twenty-two states do not allow CPMs to attend home births. If a midwife chooses to practice anyway, they are faced with the possibility of arrest.

When Mephistopheles appears and proposes a pact with Faust, the two of them set off together on a (dream) journey. Doktor Faust remained a fragment at the time of the composer's death. Busoni died in 1924, unable to complete what he himself described as his \\"state masterpiece\\" - an opera to which he had a deep personal attachment. The missing scenes from the score were completed by his pupil, Philipp Jarnach, whom Busoni had become acquainted with during his period in exile in Zurich. In this form the opera was given its first performance in Dresden in 1925. Then in the 1980s the conductor Anthony Beaumont came across previously undiscovered sketches by Busoni and produced a new version of Doktor Faust.
