There were many different drag strategies but drag was definitely underground, punk, subversive. Theres something about a John Kelly performance which has the heightened theatricality of a drag performance, but its also incredibly lyrical and emotional and its hard not to get caught up with the intensity and the adoration of a fan who is so deep that he actually becomes this persona.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/4/3/7/5/5/543755-the-dagmar-onassis-story-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=37fcabc1d2"},{"name":"The Invincible","tagline":"","description":"Film about a Russian Master of Martial Arts, Andrei Khromov (Rostotsky).
