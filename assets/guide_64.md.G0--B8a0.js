When they arrive in the region of Emilia-Romagna, Angelo strikes up a relationship with a wealthy marchesa connected to the fascist movement. Tonino, on the other hand, starts to follow the rebellious Giovanni, locked up for his anti-fascist stance, and the farmers who have joined in the anti-fascist forces. As the rebels are either murdered or put in prison, Tonino becomes more and more commited to their cause - especially after Giovanni is killed. When a silent movie on the condemned and dying Christ is shown on the brothers' screen, Tonino stops the action to project some slides he has taken that show who murdered Giovanni - in an action that calls for his brother and the rest of the bystanders to finally make a decision on where to place their loyalties.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/0/3/4/3/1/303431-the-magic-screen-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=81ef782abb"},{"name":"Apollo","tagline":"","description":"This rarely-screened work, evoking distant planetary landscapes, is listed by the Center for Visual Music as one of Belsons unfinished and/or unreleased films.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"By the Sea","tagline":"","description":"\\"A film made from my old studio apartment on Telegraph Hill.
