We spent a month filming his day to day life in Houston, during the Iranian-American hostage crisis of 1980. The film was meant to describe in subtle ways what it is to be a political exile in times of political crisis.  PBS found it to be a little too subtle, and declined to air it nationally, but the film was televised on various individual PBS outlets,  and seeing it recently, I was struck by how, a generation later, we're still dealing with this same situation  - the clash between Islam and the West.

It was inspired after the success of the pre-Code exploitation film Ingagi (1931) about gorilla-worshipping Congolese native women, and after the success of RKO's King Kong (1933). The film speculated that there was social/sexual intercourse or matings between African women and gorillas, after a Ubangi maiden was abducted by a gorilla and carried off into the jungle. It was considered scandalous and \\"off-color\\" by the Board of Review because of the theme of \\"the mating of women with wild animals and because of nude figures in the picture.\\" The film included sensational content (ineptly interspersed with horrible stock footage) including a few shots of topless native women (censored versions superimposed fake ferns over bare breasts) and lusty gorillas (men in monkey suits).

Powerful images such as this are both literal and metaphoric documents of the tragedies of the age.
