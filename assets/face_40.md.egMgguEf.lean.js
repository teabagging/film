Many producers, daunted by a very long evening, made even longer by extended intervals necessary for the changing of very different sets, have been tempted into splitting and pairing them with other short operas.  In this Modena production Amarilli Nizza appears in all three operas; as the faithless wife Giorgetta in Il tabarro, as Suor Angelica and as Gianni Schicchis daughter Lauretta.

While the setting is unusual the film addresses a wide range of emotions and morality; Love, deceit, frustrated longings and human dignity.  Victor, the eponymous hero of the film, is torn between his desire for the supermodel Kate le Font and the genuine affection of his co-worker Herdis. Victor's story comes to a head when a crooked traffic warden accuses him to hide his own crimes. With Herdis' help our hero narrowly avoids disaster.  In a surprisingly complex plot, the film illustrates the dangers of repressed emotions, the liberating power of love and the ultimate triumph of good. All this takes place within the microcosmic context of the traffic warden's world which becomes a reflection of all human drama.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/7/8/5/5/5/978555-victor-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=1b16b2b059"},{"name":"Silk a stra?idla","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Buddy","tagline":"The Buddy Holly Story","description":"\\"Buddy\\" tells the compelling story of the legendary rocker Buddy Holly and the three years in which he became the world's top recording artist.

From a very young age, he did everything for his younger brother, Mimis, sacrificing his own career to study the other. Mimis, instead of looking at his studies and lessons, preferred to spend his time in fun and entertainment. He went on to do the same prodigious life, and when he went to post-graduate studies in Germany, and when he returned, he even did not hesitate to cast himself on Anna, his brother's girlfriend. Vassilis had forgiven him for all this and reached up to the point of admitting that he was the drunk driver who dragged someone and left him helpless, dying in the middle of the road. For this criminal negligence of his brother, Vasilis is now in the dock, but he does not regret his choice. The one who regrets is Mimis, who gets angry at the court and assumes his responsibilities, admitting his guilt.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/0/3/6/2/0/403620---0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=9369aa4f17"},{"name":"Children on Camera - A Primer about Movies","tagline":"","description":"Minimalist movie making at its best: kids learn the art of film language using illustrations and margarine boxes.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/9/2/3/1/7/1092317-children-on-camera-a-primer-about-movies-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=86a457113f"},{"name":"Es lebe der Tod","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Mysteries","tagline":"","description":"A double murder is committedCpresumably.

The spectacular images opened up completely new perspectives on skiing, which at the time was primarily seen as a high-speed sport.
