The camera lingers on the faces of the two men and the rummaging in the sink as they mutter idle conversations about sand. This is a dense cinematic space, where the hot, rough texture of the sand makes your whole body tingle. The coquettishness of the woman's hair, her neck, her lips, her tongue, her gestures and her voice, captured by the gazing camera, is an intense eroticism. This is a work of high perfection in which the artist's unique world of sensuality is penetrated.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/4/5/5/4/0/845540--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=fd746c3a5c"},{"name":"Wind.

It expresses nothing, does nothing, to the point of appearing to blur the image. In the second part, it works. Always very mysteriously. The viewer built himself a sense of all these actions cut by the film. Whatever it is, its activity is internalized: slide analysis, reading, writing. The outlines of this figure then draw, and blend back into the urban landscape, this time in the open. The character became somebody through a symbolic initiation: nighter? read de Sade? photographic activity? maybe three at a time, perhaps in a dream.

Directed by Catherine Duncan. Christmas in Australia is a mid summer festival, with temperatures rising high.  Over the years many of the traditional northern hemisphere Christmas customs have been modified to fit the climate. Cool drinks have taken the place of hot refreshments and much time is spent out of doors but the spirit of Christmas is unchanged and Santa Clause still arrives with snow glistening in his beard!","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/6/4/3/1/3/664313-christmas-under-the-sun-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=351c61b0aa"},{"name":"'Neath Canadian Skies","tagline":"JAMES OLIVER CURWOOD'S GREAT ACTION NOVEL COMES TO LIFE!","description":"Canadian Mountie investigates a murder posing as a criminal.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/8/3/3/5/0/283350--neath-canadian-skies-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=a1c9166bd5"},{"name":"Treasures from Trash","tagline":"","description":"This short film presents an unusual Beverly Hills store called the Patio Shop, where trash is turned into art.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/4/2/4/5/8/542458-treasures-from-trash-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=68cb4518ae"},{"name":"No Mutton fer Nuttin'","tagline":"","description":"Blackie the Lamb has two goals in life: to keep his nephews from listening to swing music, and to keep from getting caught by Wolfie the Wolf.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/6/6/1/6/5/166165-no-mutton-fer-nuttin--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=66c071217f"},{"name":"His Name Is Sukhe-Bator","tagline":"","description":"The film tells about the founder of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, the leader of the Mongolian People's Revolution - Damdin Sukhe-Bator.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/1/3/2/0/0/613200-his-name-is-sukhe-bator-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=5df3a5912c"},{"name":"Opera Ball","tagline":"","description":"After the operetta of the same name of Richard Heuberger in 1890-1914 all kinds of situation comic from happy-go-lucky Vienna of the turn of the century, the time of the first cars and the absurd bath costumes: Husbands in the Chambre Separee, her little dizziness and mistake plays, the tumultuous whirl of a grand ball... - A high-spirited comedy at considerable entertainment level.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/7/8/5/6/67856-opera-ball-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=4832334b61"},{"name":"The Streets of New York","tagline":"","description":"The story revolves around the efforts of the middle-class family Fairweather, newly impoverished by the financial panic, to survive against the villainous banker Gideon Bloodgood.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/9/5/4/3/8/595438-the-streets-of-new-york-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=5cfe530683"},{"name":"Chocolate and Soldiers","tagline":"","description":"Chocolate and Soldiers (祳\`Ȥȱ, Chokorto to Heitai) is a 1938 Japanese war film directed by Sato Takeshi and one of the most effective Japanese propaganda films of the late 1930s.
