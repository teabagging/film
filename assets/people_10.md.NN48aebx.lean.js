At last the proprietor loses all patience and decides to discharge Cud. Accordingly he summons him to his private office and demands a settlement of the broken dishes and spoiled food. Cud is unable to see the situation this way at all. The disagreement waxes hot and furious and Cud in revenge breaks all the dishes in the pantry. The riot brings the frightened guests to their feet, where they stand spellbound at seeing a half of the waiters flee before the burly Cud, who is flinging plates after them with the accuracy of a baseball pitcher.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/5/3/6/1/3/353613-everything-comes-to-him-who-waits-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=3a41e466f6"},{"name":"Film Correspondence From the Theater of the Italo-Turkish War","tagline":"","description":"Series of nine split-reel documentaries chronicling the Italian-Turkish War.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Cidade de Bebedouro - Est. de S?o Paulo","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Calino achte un chien de garde","tagline":"","description":"But when he refuses to tip the assistants at the fancier's sales room they lay a scheme for revenge, which takes the form of a practical joke and supplies the onlookers with much merriment.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"The Broken Doll","tagline":"","description":"An American Indian child, maltreated by her mother and other tribespeople, accompanies her family to a nearby town to buy supplies.

To all but a few who have made a study of Hellenic dancing such grace of action, such lithesomeness of body as was essential to the art when Grecian beauties tripped lightly and rhythmically over the green sward, is impossible. Mesdemoiselles Napierkowska and Marly, however, are superb in an exquisitely graceful ballet by Sacha Dezac, entitled \\"In Ancient Greece.\\" The dance is perfect and the quality of the film is such that it is difficult to believe that the dancers do not themselves appear in the flesh before the eyes of the spectators, instead of being a mere photographic reproduction of their swaying rhythmic movements.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/6/0/8/1/7/760817-dans-l-hellade-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=76fc5164ff"},{"name":"Italian Naval Maneuvers","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/0/3/5/9/4/303594-le-manovre-navali-italiane-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=07ce32a64b"},{"name":"Revue du Bardo : commencement du dfil. tat-major.

Everything has a year of Insta teasers and trailers as if it wont be forgotten the day it gets bumped five spaces on a YouTube subscription feed. Bronze has been the northeasts most influential thinktank for over half a decade now, and that comes right down to them not being dicks about teasing everyone with an upcoming video. Unlike less #relevant institutions, they didnt need a decade to drop a two-minute clip of falls. Enron just came out with no hype, on a quiet Sunday night while everyone waited for the rain to start. Its every bit as good as you expect it to be :)  This one is perhaps a bit heavier on the video art side of things than even Solo Jazz, but at least theres a totally *hot* Brendan Carroll part, not to mention some other new faces within the Bronze franchise.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/3/3/4/8/4/833484-bronze-56k-enron-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=4aeae6754d"},{"name":"The Cabin Attendant","tagline":"New York Murder Case","description":"Miho (Kyoko Fukada) works as a cabin attendant for an international airline.
