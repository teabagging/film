In the second part of this second chapter, Mondzain analyses another visual material: that of the rushes recorded during the shooting of the first chapter. These rushes could have been left invisible, or rather 'unseen'- the same way some of the Algerians historical figures are not represented on the pictures of the kiosk. In her book, Limage peut-elle tuer? [Can the image kill?], Mondzain defines the 'unseen' as what is waiting for meaning in the community debate.

By 2000, however, the U.S. Census Bureau indicates that a full one-third of lesbian couples and roughly a quarter of gay male couples had opted to become parents. This program captures six gay/lesbian families in their day-to-day lives. Two of these families are families by adoption, two are co-parenting families, and two are lesbian families by insemination.

Because his articles directly exposed stock market corruption and local government brutality to the public, people threatened to pay 500,000 yuan for his head. This attracted the attention of Premier Zhu Rongji. Wang was instructed to employ protection. This film documents Wang Keqin's interview experience in Min County, Gansu Province. Wang Keqin once wrote reports about officials oppressing the people there, which received widespread attention, so the cadres were brought to justice. The general public increased their legal awareness as a result of this incident, which also resulted in challenges to township governance. In the days that followed, the farmers who defended their rights continued to experience retaliation from the village cadres, and they kept calling Wang Keqin about their experiences.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Lions Behaving Badly","tagline":"","description":"We think of the lion as the king of beasts - the perfect predators - built to make a swift clean kill - but think again.

Seven out of the eight cubs are male - for them the clock is ticking, within two years they need to learn to hunt before setting out and finding new territories of their own, to avoid treading on the toes of the dominant pride male. The cubs hunting lessons are perhaps not what you might expect; instead of ambushing their prey and quickly despatching with a clean bite to the throat, these lions wrestle their victim to the ground and tuck in before the hapless beast is dead. When the prey is a young elephant, it means a slow and painful death.

These are the women who fought against the many forms of racism they faced in Canada while, at the same time, challenging sexism within their own communities. By passing on language, culture, and values to their children, these women defined what it means to be Chinese Canadian. Beautiful old photographs from family albums, the recollections of seven women who grew up in Canada in the first half of the 20th century, and the memories of narrator and director, Dora Nipp, whose grandfather came to Canada in 1881 to build the railway, create a remarkable story of stunning impact.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/3/3/5/3/9/1133539-under-the-willow-tree-pioneer-chinese-women-in-canada-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=ccf6d3a9e3"},{"name":"Como agua para atole","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/3/2/5/8/0/732580-como-agua-para-atole-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=9cde9ac095"},{"name":"Sight Adjuster 3 (Left)","tagline":"","description":"Short film directed by Chen Shiaixiong.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Kahit Kailan","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/0/5/4/8/6/905486-kahit-kailan-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=14396e3cc7"},{"name":"October 25th & 26th, 1996","tagline":"","description":"Super 8 document of the inflatable tunnel project by the October Group during the Metro Days of Action.

The artist thus prevents the illusion of three dimensions from materializing. He draws attention to the flat wall, which in turn recalls the flatness of the film stock. Therefore, like The Straight Curve, Wall features an attempt at reducing the 3D illusion of the film to two-dimensionality, more adequate to its physical properties.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/9/3/0/2/7/893027-sciana-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=280d63afee"},{"name":"Jdi tam C nevm kam, p?ines to C nevm co","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"An Ideal Husband","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/2/6/5/4/2/426542-un-mari-ideal-theatre--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=6e8773974e"},{"name":"Compromiso con Chile","tagline":"","description":"Made by Fernando Balmaceda in 1972, it is a documentary that shows the presence of the State Technical University throughout Chile through its provincial headquarters, with teaching, scientific research, technological development, cultural extension and the relationship with the historical moment of the country.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/6/6/6/7/0/1066670-compromiso-con-chile-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=aad64cab40"},{"name":"Og?oszenie matrymonialne","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Orion","tagline":"","description":"electronically generated film, with electronic sound track","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"The Breaking of Boys and the Making of Men in 'The Cowboys'","tagline":"","description":"Featurette on the \\"The Cowboys\\" (1972)","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"America, America","tagline":"","description":"A song sets the tone, followed by an animated collage in which Super 8-film, photographs, drawings, slides, detritus and fragments from music and popular culture are used and processed.

The motion could be varied and stopped at any time, allowing the artist to create varying designs and images. Opening with a close-up of a womans face covered in reflected lights, the majority of the film is comprised of flashing lights and spinning colours. The NBC peacock symbol appears intermittently throughout the film, at the forefront of the image.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/4/6/7/6/7/1046767-nbc-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=d956754c5d"},{"name":"The great oath","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/4/9/1/9/4/449194---0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=416526f1dc"},{"name":"Desarraigo","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/2/5/0/0/0/1025000-desarraigo-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=bf599b851e"},{"name":"I manichini","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"New Musical Express Poll Winners Concert","tagline":"","description":"The U.K.'s New Musical Express poll winners concert.

Before the First World War in Berlin he made many paintings of the theater, music-hall and opera; he loved flowers and even coaxed a garden out of the salty soil of the Baltic coast, where he had built himself an isolated house. His parents were Frisian peasants and he loved the landscape of North Friesland: it was the theme of many of his pictures. But the Nazis disapproved of his work and finally forbade him to paint at all. Although Nolde was already in his seventies when this happened, no political regime could stifle his vision. At great danger to himself he continued to work, making watercolour sketches the size of postcards, which he called 'unpainted pictures,' meaning them to serve as sketches for the large oils he would paint when he was free. And he did outlive the Nazi regime, marrying a twenty-eight-year-old woman in 1948 and painting up until the year before he died.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/5/3/7/9/2/453792-emil-nolde-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=1e6b64274a"},{"name":"The Engagement Ring","tagline":"","description":"Pedro and Isabel disagree on the number of children they'll have when they get married.
