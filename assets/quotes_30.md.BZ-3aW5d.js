Lions, leopards and hyenas are the ultimate rulers of the night, but they all have different hunting strategies. Leopards sneak up to their prey like phantoms and attack in the last moment, while lions try to ambush their next meal and take it down as a team. Hyenas are long distance athletes and hunt their victims to exhaustion.  All of this would be left in the dark, if not for extremely light sensitive lenses and thermal cameras.

Shot primarily on a single camera and with no budget in Saxapahaw and Chapel Hill, NC, We Are Here is a 55-minute documentary that investigates the intention and process of a community whose aim is to move us to action through moving art.  It takes a whole lot more than cardboard, wood, duct tape, and string to make a great show. In We Are Here, we find out what makes a puppet come to life and we are challenged to reconsider our own place in the world.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/2/3/1/5/3/823153-we-are-here-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=55f747a4c0"},{"name":"Hymns from the Abyss","tagline":"","description":"Images of moral panic, cult followings and the edges of madness from sex and death.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/4/4/0/8/8/1144088-hymns-from-the-abyss-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=43436c8134"},{"name":"Africa, le grand concert","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/7/0/5/2/0/770520-africa-le-grand-concert-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=8474e87310"},{"name":"I Love Fake Robot Girlfriends","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/7/0/0/2/5/770025--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=d79aee54b1"},{"name":"Bonsai","tagline":"","description":"Zac has just moved away from home and during a party he loses his housewarming gift from his mother, a bonsai tree.

Ahmad Zakii Anwar's paintings of naked male bodies are both provocative and fascinating, especially in a country like Malaysia, where Islamic Sharia law prevails. It is a society that still regards nakedness and even being different as taboo. The 63-year-old Anwar, who is one of Malaysia's most sought-after artists in Western countries, sees himself as an urban realist looking for confrontation. It is the first time a documentary has looked at the painter and his work in detail and examined its meaning in both a radicalizing society and a liberal one.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/0/3/7/7/6/503776-edge-of-obedience-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=9c7dfbfd22"},{"name":"Claude Fran?ois, l'ombre au tableau","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/2/8/7/6/7/528767-claude-francois-l-ombre-au-tableau-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=aec48c7d92"},{"name":"Julia 17","tagline":"","description":"A story about abandonment, inner turmoil and self-recognition.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/2/4/7/4/0/1024740-julia-17-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=c1c1e8b6d3"},{"name":"Kanyadaan","tagline":"","description":"Two small children, Rekha and Amar, undergo a marriage ceremony under the guidance of their respective parents.

JJ Stratfords formal exploration of the LZX Video Synthesizer and the Fairlight Computer Video Instrument (CVI) resulted in a suite of 10 short experimental videos questioning obsolescence and early video aesthetics. At first glance, one could mistakenly take this work to be a study of dead-media fetishism. However, one watches this suite unfold into a delicate investigation of the limits of technology, and the potential those limits enable. Through the use of preset wipes and crude RGB color palettes, Stratford uncovers hidden potential in what otherwise would be considered a long-outmoded device for creative expression. In doing so, the typical subversive gesture of using obsolete technology that occurs within contemporary art is supplanted by an earnest exploration into a crucial link between early video aesthetics and current technologically inflected imagery.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"HaChazan VeHayam","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Asobi Hangun de Itte wa Ikenai Shinrei Supotto: Saish-hen","tagline":"","description":"Eighth installment of the \\"Asobi Hangun de Itte wa Ikenai Shinrei Supotto series.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/2/0/3/2/9/1120329-asobi-hangun-de-itte-wa-ikenai-shinrei-supotto-saishu-he-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=aeac079b30"},{"name":"A Drag Queen for Kids","tagline":"","description":"A short film that follows Dito Van Reigersberg and his alter ego, Martha Graham Cracker, as they prepare for and perform their show for kids Martha Graham Cracker Meets Dr. Seuss.
