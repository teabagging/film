Shankar and percussionist T.H. Vinayakram, the latter two hailing from South India. Together, they created a fluid and organic sound that managed to successfully combine seemingly incompatible traditions. After a number of very successful live concerts and albums they disbanded. The group was reformed in 1997 under the name Remember Shakti with new talents from India, such as V. Selvaganesh, who replaced his father Vinayakram on percussion, and the young prodigy U.

In 2000, the young Indian classical singer Shankar Mahadevan joined as the first vocal element in the group.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/7/4/1/7/7/374177-shakti-timeless-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=0647a0f836"},{"name":"WAL-TOWN The Film","tagline":"6 Activists, 36 Towns, 1 Corporation","description":"In this feature documentary, 6 student activists visit 36 Canadian towns to take on one giant corporation.

The video documents and further explores Graham's investigations of the urban environment, from Abbe Laugier's theory of the Rustic Hut to Parisian shopping arcades, wintergardens, museums, Disneyland and corporate office buildings. For the Dia Center in New York City, Graham developed an environment, analogous to a small-scale urban park, which integrates aesthetic and utilitarian functions, and spatial and visual experiences, bringing the landscape into the roof and extending the roof into the landscape. Graham writes: \\"The pavilion structures are psychologically and socially self-reflective. There is a dialectic between the perception of oneself and other bodies perceiving themselves, making the spectator conscious of him or herself as a body.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/2/9/5/1/0/629510-two-way-mirror-cylinder-inside-cube-and-a-video-salon-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=5b1bb654d6"},{"name":"The Final Heist","tagline":"","description":"David King is an art thief who has retired to devote his time to his daughter on whom he dotes.
