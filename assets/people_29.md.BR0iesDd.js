Yoshida Shin ( , 1830-1859) was one of the most distinguished intellectuals in the closing days of the Tokugawa shogunate. He devoted to developing many Ishin Shishi who made an outstanding contribution to the Meiji Restoration. At least two of his students, Takasugi Shinsaku and It Hirobumi later became famous, and virtually all of the survivors of the Sonjuku group became officers in the Meiji Restoration. Takasugi led rifle companies against the shogun's army when it failed to conquer Chsh in 1864, rapidly leading to the fall of the Tokugawa Shogunate. Ito Hirobumi became Japan's first prime minister. His admirer, Maebara Issei, was later killed rebelling against the Meiji regime.

Along with the careful, concerned people we meet, we also see some who are not quite so responsible. We witness the effects of some of the owners' neglect and lack of sensitivity to the needs of these animals from the wild. Some owners also describe their pets as exhibiting almost human traits, but is it good for animals to lose their own traits and characteristics, and acquire those of human beings?","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/5/5/2/5/9/355259-manimals-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=4e6ad97bed"},{"name":"Mi aventura en Puerto Rico","tagline":"","description":"Mom and Pop Aguilar and their two boys tour the island.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/9/3/6/0/8/293608-mi-aventura-en-puerto-rico-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=3f2b6e71c4"},{"name":"Die Jugendstreiche des Knaben Karl","tagline":"Nach den Lmmel- und Lausbubengeschichten ein neuer Lachknller","description":"At the behest of his father, the young Karl Valentin is to complete a carpentry apprenticeship.
