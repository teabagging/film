Our middle-aged character's life is in a fragile balance at the start and soon that balance will, of course, be disturbed. Even without much in the way of drama at first, an at times nightmarish reality intermingles with nightmares, and, typically for a movie from this region, state bureaucracy and the absurdities of a semi-legal order play a role in moving developments along. So what is it that awaits our hero down the informal road he is officially sent? Complete deconstruction? Or the 'unbearable lightness of being'? If you give the movie the time to unfold, it will reward you revealing an entertaining concept by the end.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/6/5/6/7/5/365675-sztorno-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=517eaa48d3"},{"name":"Oma's Quilt","tagline":"","description":"Oma's Quilt is about love, life and change.

Other than the clich of a huge statue head, toppled on its side, the set manages to be suitably representative of a decaying palace as well as an imposing, theatrical space, dominated by the mammoth body of the statue from which the head apparently dropped, draped with the ropes that seem to have enabled the decapitation. Sooner or later most of the characters cling to and twist around those ropes, an apt stage metaphor for the remorseless repercussions from the murder of Agammenon by his unfaithful wife Klyt?mnestra and her paramour, Aegisthus. Reinhard Heinrichs costumes capture a distant era while sustaining a creepily modern look  part Goth, part homeless, part Spa-wear.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/4/2/2/4/9/342249-elektra-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=2801453b7d"},{"name":"Wild Angels","tagline":"","description":"After her mother and some others are slaughtered, Rani decides to investigate.
