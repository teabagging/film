Looting is a daily occurrence, and going out in search of booty becomes a boyish adventure during which the participants explore places only recently inhabited by private individuals. And when all this is recorded by a Polish television crew headed by a canny female reporter, an existential satire is born. The war is there, but somewhere around the corner.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/7/3/0/2/9/473029-eto-voyna-detka-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=61559c3ce2"},{"name":"Heart of Glass","tagline":"","description":"The film shows how passion can save lives and push the human experience beyond limits around the work of glass artist Jeremy Wintrebert.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/9/0/7/1/0/490710-heart-of-glass-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=f016f56fb8"},{"name":"Passport","tagline":"","description":"Anna, an American student comes to Ahmedabad to explore Amdavadi Culture.
