T  The libretto for \\"Cherubin\\" (1905), an homage to Beaumarchais and da Ponte, takes up the story of the character Cherubino from Mozart's \\"Le nozze di Figaro\\" and shows him suffering his first great disappointment in love, his rejection by the courtesan/dancer Ensoleillad. All ends happily, however, as Cherubin finds his real destiny in Nina, a girl his own age. The story is tightly constructed, the text full of wit and humor in lighter moments and rapturous poetry in the love scenes, and the DVD's subtitles are expertly handled.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/2/9/0/7/0/429070-cherubin-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=084c96697d"},{"name":"Dexterity: Reggae Madness","tagline":"","description":"With his first music video collection, world-famous reggae DJ Dexterity pulls out all the stops -- literally.

For the first time, a seven-year investigation is being carried out into the history of the Jewish deaf under Nazism. It began in 1993, with a debate organized at the Bagnolet library, which showed that the deaf, gagged by their inability to speak, were unable to testify. Numerous testimonies, interspersed with images of the places where sterilizations took place (Hadamar hospital, Berlin...) and the Auschwitz museum, support this discussion. Historians such as Horst Biesold, a specialist in the problem of the deaf under Nazism, break the silence, unmasking the perverse logic of the Nazi regime in terms of racial hygiene and the annihilation of the disabled, and denounce the crucial role played by doctors in this sinister process.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/1/6/9/3/3/1116933-temoins-sourds-temoins-silencieux-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=666d27029e"},{"name":"ܶĥ","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/0/5/4/3/7/9/1054379--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=e50622a04f"},{"name":"It's a Jolly Life","tagline":"","description":"Reverend IM Jolly looks back at his career as he prepares for his final Last Call","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Komede-Scheuer M?ulesmhle - Rutsch mr doch dr Buckel nuff","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/8/7/8/8/9/587889-rutsch-mr-doch-dr-buckel-nuff-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=6ecb9fa157"},{"name":"3 Days... 3 Hours... 3 Minutes... 3 Seconds","tagline":"","description":"African-American indie film.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"InnerCity 1999","tagline":"","description":"The ID&T party indoor at Amsterdam RAI 1999","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/8/5/7/7/8/185778-innercity-1999-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=5ed0250a2a"},{"name":"Battle of Love","tagline":"","description":"Wei Yangsheng went around looking for the whereabouts of his offspring's roots.

Here black workers faced opposition not only from the bosses, but from some Trade Unions as well as fellow white workers. And the film demonstrates that the outrage of young black people (many born in Britain) as seen in the dramatic events of Summer 1981, is related to the disappointed hopes of their migrant-worker parents.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Dolores","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Heloisa a Abelard","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Jagav p?
