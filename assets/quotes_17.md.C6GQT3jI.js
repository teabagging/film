This is the question asked by Henrik Ibsen's drama Ghosts (Gengangere). Oswald Alving returns from a bohemian existence in Paris to small-town Norway. Encountering people who do not communicate, Oswald responds by becoming ironic and distant. He gradually learns more of the secrets that weigh on his family, as well as those inside himself. His mother, Mrs Alving, welcomes her much-missed son home - and slowly understands what, or whom, he has brought home with him. Together with the young, critically acclaimed choreographer Cina Espejord, she retells Ibsen's play as a ballet. The pair feel the story is suited to dance because both it's inner and outer brutality can be pitted against the power of dance. Ibsen's Ghosts is an evocative production in a modern dance style. Nils Petter Molv?r has composed new music, which he performs on-stage together with Jan Bang.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/5/8/4/3/0/958430-ibsen-s-ghosts-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=d27fcc1daa"},{"name":"Voices from the Urbanscape","tagline":"","description":"Visions of construction in contemporary Doha neatly express its nearly manic pace of growth, while various voices from the community describe the citys progress, lament the loss of nature that goes with urbanisation, consider the beauty of the new buildings, and discuss Dohas cosmopolitan personality.

To St. Petersburg, to the corner of Pestel and Liteyny, to the Muruzi house. This film is an attempt at a group portrait of those whom Brodsky would have found if he had had the opportunity to return to Russia today. Formally, the characters of the film are talking about Brodsky. But in these stories, not literary critics, but people who have been strongly influenced by Brodsky, whom they have never seen, there are so many of themselves that a portrait of an entire generation has come out. Generations of Joseph Brodsky's children who had never seen their father with their own eyes in their lives.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/3/3/0/4/8/633048--80--0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=a1f7332934"},{"name":"Neue Natur: Art Girls Intern","tagline":"","description":"","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/5/0/9/7/4/450974-neue-natur-art-girls-intern-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=7fadbac023"},{"name":"The Waler: Australia's Great War Horse","tagline":"","description":"Over 130,000 Australian horses served in the 1914 - 1918 war.
