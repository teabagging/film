Inventor Louis Le Prince vanishes under mysterious circumstances right after he created a device that, five years later, the Lumire Brothers will call The Cinematographer. What if they had stolen Le Princes idea and wacked him afterwards? The mystery remains for more than a century, until Luigi Cozzi picks up a strange book called The Roaming Universe in the horror museum of his pal Dario Argento. The origin of this enigmatic book troubles him. This particular science-fiction novel would have materialized during a spiritual session in modern day Rome. At the session, an old woman revealed that the key to all these mysteries comes from 1895, a time during which the Lumire Brothers had denied lending their camera to Georges Mlis for an obscure movie called \\"A Trip to the moon\\". Not only does this film actually exist, but it raises a more intriguing question.
