Two distinctive yellow canisters, similar to those previously linked to chlorine gas attacks across Syria, were found following the strikes. Days later, following the negotiated surrender of the remaining rebel forces in Douma, Russian media were the first to be allowed access to the attack sites. Reporters from RT and TV Zvezda quickly claimed that the attacks had been staged. Commissioned by and working closely with the New York Times, Forensic Architecture searched for physical evidence concerning how the canisters had arrived at each scene, providing analysis that supports the assessment that the canisters were dropped from the air.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/9/3/7/6/3/493763-chemical-weapons-attack-in-douma-syria-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=8c77b67a3d"},{"name":"The Toothmans","tagline":"","description":"Quietly nestled in McConnellsburg, a rural town in Pennsylvania, a relatively normal family faces challenges as their daughter comes out as transgender.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/7/5/6/3/6/475636-the-toothmans-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=acc4c0bf01"},{"name":"Foi-se","tagline":"","description":"After an unexpected event, Death has its function forever threatened.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/5/8/1/3/1/458131-foi-se-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=f66f6a4180"},{"name":"Inside Cadbury: Secrets of the Chocolate Factory","tagline":"","description":"For almost 200 years Cadbury had been the home of chocolate.

The music starts with a single rhythmic motif, which subsequently multiplies and unfolds into a rich cornucopia of textures including drums, woodwinds, brass and voice. Reich here ramps up the technique already used in his earlier composition Piano Phase: through minor tempo accelerations the musicians almost imperceptibly push their unison out of joint, resulting in a never-ending volley of canons. In the dance, the choreographic complexity was devised in a similar fashion: a single movement phrase serves as the foundation for an infinite number of variations across time and space. When the music stops and the bodies come to a halt, the audience realizes what they have witnessed: a wave of pure dance and pure sound, a vortex of vital energy.","rating":"","theme":"","link":""},{"name":"Bear Cop","tagline":"","description":"Police officer Hank Decker battles a war against the most vicious of beasts, bears that commit 'people crimes.'

Seven years in the making, this film became the turning point in Lehmuskallios artistic path. I started from Inuit poetry. I believe that paintings are also poetry. () They were kept behind glass: I could not touch them, I could not feel the warmth left by their creators. Inside myself, I could hear their voices. It was like an assignment from them: I had to show them to the world through myself, through my brain and soul.

Competition from supermarkets and shopping centers threatens the livelihoods of long-term residents. High land prices tempt owners to tear down old homes and replace them with apartment buildings; this in turn is changing the composition of the population. Against this backdrop, residents strive to maintain the close social ties, symbols of local identity, and community rituals that keep Miyamoto-cho from becoming just another mailing address.
