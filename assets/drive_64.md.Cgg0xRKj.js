During his stay he rediscovers the music of harana - a long-forgotten tradition of Filipino serenading when men sang under the window at night to fearlessly declare their love for a woman.  Intent on unearthing these unheralded songs, Florante travels to the remote provinces where he discovers three of the last surviving practitioners - a farmer, a fisherman and a tricycle driver. Astounded by their golden voices, Florante asks them to travel with him to perform and record these unknown songs. During their travels, the haranistas meet Brian, a shy young man who for years has been secretly in love with a schoolmate. The haranistas, who have not serenaded in the last thirty years, offered their services to serenade Brian's object of affection, resulting in one of the most tender moments of genuine harana captured on film.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/4/9/9/2/2/149922-serenade-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=e8123b2229"},{"name":"Nightmare Alley","tagline":"","description":"Cheap thrills!

The hero of the show is a yellow shape-shifting robot called Indrikis XIII, who usually takes the form of a cat. He flies through space, mediating various disputes between the other characters. One recurring dynamic in the show is the love triangle between Indrikis XIII and Receklite - the flying purple cat-octopus with whom he is in love with, and the rat C who is in love with Indrikis. Other recurring characters include a cow, a (human) woman, and an amorphous pink blob.  The episode \\"Salt\\" won the Lielais Kristaps award for best animation in 1985. The show has no dialogue and drama unfolds through pantomime and expressive noises such as grunts, groans, and laughter, which allows the show to cross language barriers.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/5/9/0/2/3/759023-fantadrome-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=c5c44a382c"},{"name":"Jean Genet: An Interview with Antoine Bourseiller","tagline":"","description":"An interview with artist, playwright, and political activist Jean Genet.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/6/4/3/0/3/364303-jean-genet-entretien-avec-antoine-bourseiller-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=fd706148e6"},{"name":"Howard in Particular","tagline":"","description":"An old man reluctantly attends his retirement party, which consists of a six minute taped conversation in an empty room.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/5/7/8/9/9/257899-howard-in-particular-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=91e34bf5bd"},{"name":"November 1828","tagline":"","description":"A group of Javanese villagers are driven to revolt against the Dutch colonialists in this historical drama, which revolves around the themes of loyalty and treachery.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/1/0/8/5/9/210859-november-1828-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=5beb9dfecb"},{"name":"31st of June","tagline":"","description":"A lonely journalist in some West European country has a vision about the princess of his city who lived in XII century.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/7/3/6/1736-31st-of-june-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=ddd9a3414e"},{"name":"Lisa, Bright and Dark","tagline":"A young girl cries for help ...","description":"Three teenage girls try to help their girlfriend, who is having a nervous breakdown that conventional therapy seems to be failing to remedy.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/4/0/0/2/4/240024-lisa-bright-and-dark-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=fd14db4c76"},{"name":"The Lustful Turk","tagline":"The Monumental Achievement in Adult Motion Pictures!","description":"Two English women and their female servant are kidnapped by pirates and sold to an Arab sheik.

El planeta de los ni?os is not a documentary and not a feature film. Sarmiento actually filmed a documentary subject with the mise-en-scne and the cutting of a feature film. Without further ado, she takes the viewer into a world where adults would appear to have died out ; a society within which all functions and professions are held by children with deadly seriousness as if things have always been this way. Only right at the end does Sarmiento reveal that she shot the film at the 'Escuele de Pioneros' set up in Cuba in 1979, an institution which Fidel Castro gave to the children of his people to prepare themselves for a later working life. The film opens with an as-good-as-real wedding ceremony and progresses via a birth to a simulated battle ; from birth to death. The subtle irony with which Sarmiento portrays this 'Utopian' world was not understood by all German critics.","rating":"","theme":"","link":"https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/5/7/8/8/5/357885-planet-of-the-children-0-230-0-345-crop.jpg?v=cb09a2fdb8"},{"name":"North","tagline":"","description":"The story of a dysfunctional family in Northern France.

The dialogue between Delia and her brother (played by Fiorenzo Fiorentini), when he does (or does not) tell her he is a homosexual, is memorable, a primordial coming-out, a masterpiece of allusions.
